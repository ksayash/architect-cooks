                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This baked aubergine dish is a flavorful and visually appealing vegetarian option, perfect as a side dish or a light main course. The aubergine, also known as eggplant or brinjal, is carefully slit and salted to draw out excess moisture, ensuring a tender texture. The filling is a delightful mix of mashed potatoes, cheese, cream, and a medley of spices, creating a rich and savory flavor profile. The addition of chili flakes, mixed herbs, coriander, and green chilies adds a touch of heat and freshness. Topped with grated cheese and baked to a golden brown, this dish is a delightful combination of textures and tastes. It pairs well with garlic toast or soup, making it a versatile and satisfying meal.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius (338 degrees Fahrenheit) on bake mode.</li>
<li>Make slits on the aubergine, as shown in the video. Apportion salt and leave aside for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Mix all the ingredients for the stuffing.</li>
<li>Squeeze the aubergines to remove water. Oil the baking dish and the aubergines. Stuff well. Oil lightly on top.</li>
<li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 40-45 minutes, until the aubergine is tender. Check with a fork or knife to ensure it is tender.</li>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"Whether you're building a new house or you have an existing house in which you have various rooms and you want to designate some function, do keep it, keep in mind the orientation of the room vis-a-vis the movement of the sun." The north side of a building never gets direct sunlight, so it is ideal for rooms where direct sunlight is not desired, such as a study. Balconies should be in the east or south, where you can get the rising sun or sun throughout the day.</p>
