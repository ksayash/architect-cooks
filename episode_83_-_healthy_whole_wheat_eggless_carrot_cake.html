                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a healthy take on a classic carrot cake. Instead of using all-purpose flour, this recipe uses whole wheat flour, making it a more nutritious option. It also uses jaggery instead of sugar, adding a unique flavor and sweetness. The addition of mixed nuts provides a delightful crunch and nutty flavor. The cake is moist and flavorful, thanks to the combination of grated carrots, curd, and fresh cream. It's a perfect treat for those looking for a guilt-free indulgence. The recipe is simple to follow and can be made in a jiffy.</p>
