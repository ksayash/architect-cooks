                    <p>When building a house, reinforcement is very important. Different thicknesses of steel bars have to be brought to the site. Invariably, some extra steel bars are left over. To protect them from the weather, apply commercial chemicals to the steel bars to prevent them from rusting and losing strength.</p>
