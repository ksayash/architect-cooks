                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Gobi Paratha is a simple, traditional recipe that has been passed down through generations. It is a favorite of many, especially during the winter months. The key to a good Gobi Paratha is to use completely dry cauliflower, which helps prevent the paratha from becoming soggy. The addition of spices like ginger, coriander, red chili powder, and dry mango powder adds a depth of flavor that is both comforting and satisfying. The paratha is cooked with ghee, which gives it a rich, buttery taste and a crispy texture. Served hot with butter and curd, this dish is a perfect way to start the day or enjoy a hearty meal.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When building a house, the sill level is usually 2 feet 6 inches. However, in the kitchen, that doesn't hold true. If the window is lower than 4 feet from the ground, the outside air will disrupt the gas flame. Therefore, kitchen windows should always be put at a height of a minimum of 4 feet from the ground level.</p>
