                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Lahsuni Kurkuri Bhindi is a delightful and zesty Indian snack or side dish that combines the earthy flavors of okra with the pungent aroma of garlic. This recipe transforms ordinary okra into a crispy, flavorful treat that can be enjoyed as an evening snack or as a side dish with your main course. The okra is thinly sliced and coated in a blend of spices, garlic paste, and a mixture of besan (gram flour) and cornflour, which gives it a satisfying crunch when fried. The addition of lemon juice and chaat masala adds a tangy twist, making it a truly irresistible dish. The recipe is versatile, allowing you to adjust the spices according to your taste preferences.</p>

                    <p>"The kitchen window can be of a large size. It's not necessary that the entire window is openable. You can have two openable panels on the side and that is sufficient for ventilation." Having a large window in the kitchen allows more light into the space and provides a view of the outside while cooking.</p>
