                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"Instead of putting, you know, some kind of barricading, what I suggest is there's a plant called ficus. Ficus to you apply close intervals pay and if groomed properly, the ficus grows to very tall heights and then they can be kind of trimmed and sheared according to the shape you need." This is a great way to create a visual barrier or barricade using a green plant, which is very pleasing to the eyes.</p>
