                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients</strong>
* 1/2 cup semi-solid desi ghee
* 1/2 cup ground sugar
* 1.5 cups whole wheat flour
* 1 tablespoon besan
* 1 teaspoon cardamom powder (optional)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong>
1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius on bake mode (lower rod only).
2. Grease a baking tray or plate.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the ghee and sugar for about 2 to 3 minutes, till it gets creamy and changes color.
4. Add the wheat flour and besan and fold with light hands.
5. Fold softly till it binds together.
6. Grease palms lightly. Make small balls (slightly flattened). Place on the tray, leaving space (since they will expand on baking).
7. Make a light cross in the center using the tip of a sharp knife.
8. Place tray in the oven. Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes, till light pink. Take out the tray immediately. Set aside to cool.
9. Do not disturb the Khatai till completely cool, or it will break.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips</strong>
* Keep the nankhatai spaced a little apart to give them space to expand.
* Do not touch or eat the nankhatai until it has cooled. It is very soft when warm and will crumble.</p>
