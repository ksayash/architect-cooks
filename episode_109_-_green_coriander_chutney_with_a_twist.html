                    <p>The video doesn't contain any architectural tips. Instead, it contains a tip for storing dhaniya (coriander) for a long period of time in the fridge. Wash the roots well, but don't cut them. Place the coriander in a small tumbler with water, so that the roots are dipped. Change the water every day or every second day.</p>
