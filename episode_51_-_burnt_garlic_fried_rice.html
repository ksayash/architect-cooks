                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Rice: ½ cup (boiled and cooled well)
* Oil: 2 Tbsp
* Garlic: 2 Tbsp (chopped finely)
* Spring onion white: 2 Tbsp (chopped)
* Carrot: ½ (chopped)
* Beans: 10-12 (chopped)
* Capsicum: ½ (chopped)
* Soy sauce: 1 tsp (dark)
* Vinegar: 1 tsp
* Black pepper powder: ½ tsp
* Salt: to taste
* Spring onion greens: 1 Tbsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. In a kadai/wok, add the oil. 
2. Add the garlic and on low heat, stir fry till golden. Take out 1 tsp of the garlic for garnishing.
3. Add the spring onions and stir until translucent. 
4. Add the carrot and beans. Saute for a minute.
5. Add the soy sauce, black pepper powder, and capsicum. Mix well. 
6. Add the rice in batches, while mixing well. 
7. Finally, add salt to taste, 1 tsp of spring onion greens, and the vinegar. Mix well.
8. Serve hot, garnished with the garlic and spring onion greens.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
* When boiling the rice, make sure it is slightly al dente.
* The rice should be cooked at least 4-5 hours before making the fried rice, or even the day before. This will help to ensure that the rice is not sticky.
* It is important to chop the garlic very finely, so that it will roast evenly in the oil.
* If you feel that the garlic is browning too quickly, turn off the heat immediately. Over-burned garlic will give the dish a bitter taste.</p>

                    <p>It is not necessary that the entire storage is see-through glass or non-see-through. You can have a mix. That gives you a kind of relaxation. The see-through, you want to be set and look beautiful. The non-see-through, you can quickly put things in there.</p>
