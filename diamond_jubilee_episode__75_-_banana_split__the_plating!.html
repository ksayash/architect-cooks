                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is for a classic dessert, the banana split. The video focuses on the presentation of the dish, rather than the cooking. The presenter shows how to simply present the banana split at home. The banana should be ripe, but not overripe. The chocolate sauce is homemade, and kept in a squeeze bottle in the fridge. The presenter uses roasted cashews, which can be purchased already broken or broken at home. The presenter uses a white plating tray to let the chocolate sauce run onto the sides.</p>

                    <p>Gardens are liked by everyone. If you don't have a ground floor apartment or a bungalow, then ground floor gardens or lawns are not possible. Then the option is the terrace garden. You can give a terrace garden, but without putting any soil or dead earth on the terrace.</p>
