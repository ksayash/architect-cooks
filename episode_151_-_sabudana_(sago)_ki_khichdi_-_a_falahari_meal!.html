                    <p>"If you have an apartment, and there are a lot of toilets near each other, or even if you have a two-story stand-alone house, then the pipes' sound can transmit to other rooms. To avoid that, use sound-insulated pipes for the plumbing. That will absorb the sound and make the dispersal of noise from the toilets very minimal."</p>
