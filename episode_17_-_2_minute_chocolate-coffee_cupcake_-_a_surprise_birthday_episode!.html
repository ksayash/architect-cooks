                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This coffee walnut cupcake is a quick and easy treat, perfect for a single serving dessert. The combination of cocoa powder and coffee powder creates a rich, mocha-like flavor that is enhanced by the addition of chopped walnuts. The recipe is designed to be simple and foolproof, even for novice cooks. It's a great way to satisfy a sweet craving without the fuss of traditional baking. The cupcake is cooked in a microwave, making it a convenient option for a quick dessert. The addition of fresh cream and curd adds moisture and richness to the cake, resulting in a soft and spongy texture.</p>

                    <p>Paints have advanced a lot. You may remember enamel paint, which was used on doors and windows. The main purpose was that it could be wiped clean and didn't stain easily. However, it had a glossy finish and these are the days of matte finishes. All the paint companies have now developed enamel paints in a matte finish. They have the qualities of a good enamel paint, that they are easy to wipe clean, but they are in a matte finish so they go well with your decor.</p>
