                    <p>Inverters are fast becoming a necessity in every household because every time there is a power cut, you don't want the generator to be on. If an inverter is on, your work is done quickly. Make sure that all the light points are connected to the inverter, so that if you are in a particular room, you can use the 300 or 500 watts in that room.</p>
