                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When living in a place like India, where insects and mosquitoes are common due to the climate, it's advisable to install <em>jali</em> doors on external entrances, excluding the main door. This allows you to open the doors in the evening for fresh air while keeping insects out. This is especially useful because it is not recommended to run the air conditioning all the time.</p>
