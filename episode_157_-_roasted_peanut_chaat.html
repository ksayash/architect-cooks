                    <p>When we build houses, there are windows. Sometimes there are wooden windows or steel window frames. Because they are next to a brick wall, you should be as accurate as possible. There will always be some gap. Use a silicone gun, which has a thin nozzle that fits in any dimension. Use silicone filling to ensure the window is leak-proof and soundproof.</p>
