                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These banana chips are a delicious and easy-to-make snack that can be enjoyed any time of day. They are made with raw bananas, which are sliced thinly and then fried until crispy. The chips are then seasoned with a blend of spices, including salt, rock salt, cumin powder, amchoor, turmeric, and black pepper powder. The result is a savory and flavorful snack that is perfect for satisfying your cravings. The addition of a small amount of salt water during frying helps to create a chemical reaction that makes the chips extra crispy. These chips can be served hot or stored in an airtight container for up to 10 days.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When designing windows, it is not necessary for the entire window to be openable. You want a big window to see the maximum visibility outside, for maximum light, but for ventilation, if you add parts and panels that are openable, that works equally good. This is because the cost of the windows increases with the number of openable panels. Smaller openable panels work fine for ventilation.</p>
