                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a great way to spice up your diet with a healthy and flavorful sprout salad. Sprouts are a very healthy part of the diet, but sometimes eating them plain can be a bit bland. This recipe spices them up with finely chopped tomatoes, onions, capsicum, and cucumber, along with seasonings like black pepper, salt, lemon juice, and optional green chilies. The addition of fresh coriander adds a burst of freshness. What makes this recipe truly unique is the innovative serving method. Instead of a traditional bowl, the salad is served in roasted papad cones, making it a fun and visually appealing dish for guests, children, or parties. This simple recipe is sure to earn you many compliments.</p>

                    <p>When you are designing a house, especially a multi-story one, make sure to separate the electric meters for each floor. This is because changing the wiring later can be a lot of headache and very difficult. By separating the meters during the initial design, you avoid potential problems in the future.</p>
