                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Braised potatoes with soy sauce and honey are a quick and easy side dish that is both delicious and visually appealing. The baby potatoes are cooked in a sauce made from soy sauce and honey, which gives them a sweet and savory flavor. The dish is garnished with sesame seeds and coriander, which add a touch of elegance. The potatoes are first browned in oil to give them a crispy exterior, then braised in the sauce until they are tender. This dish is perfect for a quick weeknight meal or a special occasion. It is also a great way to use up leftover potatoes. The combination of flavors is sure to please everyone at the table.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>In case you're planning to build a new house, my advice to you is do get a soil test done. Any two places, the soil quality is not the same. And the structural engineer who decides that your foundation depth will be, your foundation or structure may look at how much it will depend on your soil's bearing capacity. If he doesn't have those parameters, then he'll always want to design on the safer side. As a result, your structure is a little bit more expensive.</p>
