                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This fruit tart is a universally loved dessert that is simple to make. It is fully loaded with fruits, and the combination of colors makes it look pretty. The crust is made with all-purpose flour, vegetable oil, and milk, and it is baked until golden. The filling is a vanilla-flavored custard that is made with custard powder, milk, sugar, and butter. The topping is made with assorted cut fruits, such as strawberries, kiwi, and black grapes. A glaze made with jam and water is applied to the crust and the fruits to keep them from getting soggy and to give them a shine.</p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius on bake mode. Grease the tart dish.</li>
<li>Mix all ingredients for the crust. Bring together and line the tart dish with it. Prick with a fork. Bake for 20-25 minutes, till golden.</li>
<li>Mix the custard powder in 100ml cold milk. Put 400ml milk to boil in a pan. Once it comes to a boil, switch flame to low and add the custard mixture and butter. Mix till thick. Switch off. Once cool, put in fridge to chill.</li>
<li>Cut the fruits for topping.</li>
<li>Mix the jam with water and microwave for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Once the crust is cool, apply the glaze inside to keep it from getting soggy on putting the custard. Once the glaze is dry, fill it with the cold custard. Top with the fruits and apply the glaze on the fruits too, to retain moisture and give it a shine. Put in the fridge. Serve chilled.</li>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Whenever you are doing any cement work, whether it is joining the bricks or you are plastering bricks, when you mix the cement with water, do add some kind of a waterproofing compound with it. This will help prevent dampness from coming in. This makes life much easier.</p>
