                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Sabudana, also known as tapioca pearls, is a staple ingredient in Indian cuisine, especially during fasting periods like Navratri. This recipe focuses on preparing the sabudana correctly to achieve the perfect texture for dishes like khichdi, kheer, or tikkis. The key is to wash away the starch, soak the pearls, and allow them to rest. This process ensures that the sabudana becomes soft and fluffy, rather than sticky or chewy. The end result is a versatile ingredient that can be used in a variety of sweet and savory dishes.</p>

                    <p>Instead of putting a voltage stabilizer at every point where your appliance is, where your main line is coming, there you can put a big-sized voltage stabilizer. As a result, you won't see voltage stabilizers all over your house, and your electrical line coming in, the power coming in, will be safe.</p>
