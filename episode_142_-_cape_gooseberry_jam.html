                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is for a delicious jam made from cape gooseberries, also known as makko or rasbhari. This jam is a great addition to breakfast, and can be used on toast or as a filling for parathas. The tangy flavor of the cape gooseberries makes this jam unique. This recipe doesn't use any artificial colors or preservatives, making it a healthy option. The cloves add a spicy seasoning to the jam, infusing it with a beautiful aroma. It's important to cook the jam to the right consistency, as overcooking can make it too sticky and tough.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   Cape gooseberries (250g, pureed)
*   Sugar (100g)
*   Lemon juice (1 Tbsp)
*   Cloves (2)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  In a pan, add the cape gooseberry puree, cloves, and sugar.
2.  Cook until it comes to the desired consistency.
3.  Add the lemon juice and mix well.
4.  Once cool, store in clean, airtight bottles in the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong>
*   If you like your jam a little more sweet, increase the sugar quantity to about 125 grams.
*   At the beginning, you can leave it on simmer and go do other things. Once it starts to thicken, you want to be with it all the time and stir it continuously so that you don't miss the desired consistency.
*   To test if the jam is done, put a drop on a clean, cool plate. If no water droplets come out, the jam is done.</p>

                    <p>Green always adds a lot of life to any interiors. But it is not always possible to keep potted plants inside the house. For that, you can keep either green leafy plants which survive in water, like money plant, or succulents. These add so much to the interior spaces.</p>
