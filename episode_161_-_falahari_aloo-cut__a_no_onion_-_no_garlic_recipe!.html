                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Gradually we are seeing that especially in India in a lot of cities where we are living because of the traffic, because of the, you know, the sardiyon mein log aag jalate hain ya jo crops jalte hain uske chalte pollution bahut badh jati hai. AQI level is very, very bad. So my latest advice to my clients is whenever you're planning a house or you're doing the interiors, do make provision for keeping air purifiers. For that, you should give points at suitable places in each of the rooms because as of now, till things settle down a bit, it is becoming a necessity for good human health.</p>
