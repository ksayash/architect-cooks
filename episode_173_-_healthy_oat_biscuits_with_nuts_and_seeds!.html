                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These cookies are a delicious and nutritious treat, perfect for a guilt-free snack. They are made with rolled oats and whole wheat flour, making them a great source of fiber. The cookies are packed with flax seeds, chia seeds, and sesame seeds, which are full of essential nutrients. Jaggery is used as a natural sweetener, providing a healthier alternative to refined sugar. The addition of chopped nuts adds a delightful crunch and enhances the overall flavor. These cookies are easy to make and can be stored in an airtight container for later enjoyment.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   ½ cup (45g) rolled oats
*   ¼ cup (30g) whole wheat flour
*   2 Tbsp (30g) jaggery, crushed or grated
*   1 Tbsp (30g) mixed nuts, chopped
*   2 ½ Tbsp (40g) melted ghee
*   ¼ tsp baking soda
*   ½ tsp vanilla essence
*   ½ tsp cinnamon powder
*   1-2 Tbsp milk
*   1 Tbsp white sesame seeds
*   1 Tbsp flax seeds
*   1 Tbsp chia seeds</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Whisk together the melted ghee and jaggery in a bowl.</li>
<li>Add the rolled oats, whole wheat flour, chopped nuts, sesame seeds, flax seeds, chia seeds, baking soda, vanilla essence, and cinnamon powder to the bowl.</li>
<li>Mix all the ingredients together to form a sticky dough. Add milk as required to help bind the dough.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into small cookies and place them on a baking tray, leaving a little space between each cookie.</li>
<li>Bake for 15-25 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown at the base.</li>
<li>Once cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   Using rolled oats gives a better result than instant oats.
*   If the ghee is in a semi-solid state, use 2 tablespoons. If it is liquid, use 2 ½ tablespoons.
*   If the jaggery is hard, microwave it for 10 seconds to soften it.
*   Chop the raisins into small pieces to help the cookies bind better.
*   Bake the cookies on the lower rod of the oven.
*   Keep a little distance between the cookies on the baking sheet, as they will rise in size.</p>

                    <p>While the casting of the house is being done, provide a fan point in the toilets. Many people skip this, but it is important in humid weather. If you don't need it, that's fine, but the point will be there if you do.</p>
