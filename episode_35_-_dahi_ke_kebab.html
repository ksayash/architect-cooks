                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Dahi Ke Kebab is a popular Indian snack dish, also known as an appetizer. It is a vegetarian dish made primarily from hung curd (thick yogurt), paneer (Indian cheese), and spices. The dish is known for its melt-in-your-mouth texture, which is achieved by using hung curd that has been drained of excess moisture. The addition of cheese and spices enhances the flavor, making it a delightful treat. The kebabs are coated in breadcrumbs and deep-fried until golden brown, providing a crispy exterior that contrasts with the soft interior. The dish is versatile and can be served with various accompaniments like onion salad, green chutney, or tomato ketchup.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>To control the sun that you want or you do not want, do provide awnings in the house. When it is summer, you can open the awnings. But in winters, when you sit at the same place, you want direct sunlight, so it can be retracted and can be opened as and when required. The same thing happens with the windows in the house or the balconies also.</p>
