                    <p>"Whosoever stays in the topmost floor of any house or apartment or a bungalow, you are well aware that the most upper floor is because the ceiling is exposed to direct, the terrace is exposed to direct sunlight, so it tends to get very warm. It is at least three to four degrees warmer in temperature than the lower floors. So to sort that, when we do terrace treat, we do not directly concrete on the slab that is cast. You should always give a buffer inside."</p>
<p>"There are a lot of materials available in the market these days. You can take any expert's advice. One such material that's coming to mind is the lightweight cement concrete blocks. So the lightweight concrete blocks is that your load will also not add on the roof. You can give it a layer. That kind of acts as a buffer insulation zone, and on top of that, then you can do your normal flooring."</p>
