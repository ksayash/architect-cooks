                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This dish is a salad, but it can be a full-fledged meal in itself. It is a very tasty dish that is quick to make. It can be served with garlic toast or butter toast, along with a cup of hot soup. The baby potatoes are boiled with the skin on, which gives it a slight crunch. The spinach is blanched to retain the color and nutrients. The mayonnaise dressing is simple, but flavorful.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you are planning your home's interiors, one very important point to keep in mind is the positioning of the ceiling lamps or the hanging pendant lamps. The ceiling lamps not only focus on a place and bring life to it, but they act as an ornament to the room. The light that they throw, the effect of shadow that it causes, and the piece of the light itself all together give a very nice, pleasant feel to the interiors. They bring out the interiors.</p>
