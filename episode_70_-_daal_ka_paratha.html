                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This Daal Paratha recipe is a family favorite, passed down through generations. It's a great way to reuse leftover daal, transforming it into a delicious and satisfying meal. The addition of besan (gram flour) gives the paratha a wonderfully crispy texture. Finely chopped onions, coriander, and green chilies add a burst of flavor, while red chili powder provides a touch of heat. This paratha is perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it's especially popular as a tiffin (lunchbox) item for kids. Serve it with yogurt, butter, and a side of pickle for a complete and flavorful experience.</p>
