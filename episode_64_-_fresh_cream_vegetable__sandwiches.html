                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a simple, easy, and tasty sandwich that doesn't require any cooking on the gas. It is a no-gas recipe, which means that you don't have to cook anything on the stove. This sandwich uses fresh cream instead of cheese or butter. The fresh cream is made from the malai (cream) that forms on top of milk when it is boiled. The sandwich is filled with a variety of finely chopped vegetables, including cucumber, tomato, cabbage, carrot, and capsicum. The vegetables are mixed with the fresh cream and seasoned with salt and pepper. The sandwich is then stored in the fridge until ready to serve.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   10 to 12 bread slices (brown or white)
*   4 to 6 Tbsp chilled fresh malai (cream)
*   2-3 Tbsp finely chopped cucumber
*   1-2 Tbsp finely chopped tomatoes
*   1-2 Tbsp finely chopped cabbage
*   1-2 Tbsp grated carrot
*   1-2 Tbsp finely chopped capsicum
*   Salt to taste (on the lesser side)
*   ½ tsp pepper</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  Take off the edges of the bread or cut rounds from it.
2.  In a bowl, gently mix together the malai and vegetables, along with the salt (on the lesser side) and pepper. Do not over mix.
3.  Apply this mixture on the slices and cover it with another. Slightly press.
4.  Cut square sandwiches into diagonals.
5.  Store, covered with a moist cloth or cling wrap, in the fridge. Serve chilled.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong>
*   When using tomatoes, if your tomato is very juicy, remove the seeds and juice and only use the firm skin.
*   When adding salt and pepper, the quantity of salt is much, much less than the quantity you would use for making any vegetable. If you add too much salt, the sandwich will not taste good. Start with very little salt and you'll get to know what I'm telling you.
*   To store the sandwiches, cover them with a moist cloth or cling wrap to prevent them from drying out.</p>
