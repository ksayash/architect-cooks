                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When building a house, it's important to plan for future needs. One common mistake is not considering whether to install window ACs or split ACs. If you initially opt for window ACs but later decide to switch to split ACs, dealing with the drain pipe and other pipes can be cumbersome. Therefore, while planning and constructing the house, make a provision for where you would place split ACs in the future. This way, you can leave the necessary punctures in the beam during casting, making the installation process much simpler when the time comes.</p>
