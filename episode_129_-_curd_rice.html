                    <p>"Normally what happens is that we see that the balconies, we have a great desire to put green plants, but the balcony's size goes away. So a very easy way is that the balcony, many times, is your iron railings. So on those railings, you weld some rings, and in those rings, you put your potted plants, which are hanging outside the balcony." As a result, you get greenery, your balcony space isn't reduced, and the railings that allow for a disturbance of privacy are covered by the plants.</p>
