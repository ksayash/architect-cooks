                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This raw mango chutney is a delicious and versatile condiment that is perfect for adding a touch of sweet, sour, and spicy flavor to any meal. It is made with grated raw mangoes, sugar, salt, and a blend of spices, including turmeric, red chili powder, clove powder, cinnamon powder, and cumin powder. The chutney is cooked until it reaches a glazed consistency, and then it is stored in a clean, dry glass bottle. This chutney can be stored for a long time in the refrigerator. It is a great way to use up raw mangoes during the summer season, and it can be enjoyed with a variety of dishes, such as roti, paratha, rice, or even as a dip for snacks.</p>

                    <p>"Today's architectural tip is about a very traditional feature that we've been using down the ages in India. That is the brick jali. Where you need sun shade, but you want air ventilation, the solution is a jali, which not only works very well functionally, but it looks aesthetically very good also."</p>
