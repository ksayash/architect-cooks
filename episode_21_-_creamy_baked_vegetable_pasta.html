                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This baked pasta is a simple, universally loved dish that can be enjoyed for lunch, dinner, or even as an evening snack. The recipe is very versatile, allowing you to use any type of pasta, from long strands like linguini or spaghetti to short shapes like macaroni, penne, or fusilli. The key is to avoid the smallest rice grain pasta. The dish is also customizable with your favorite vegetables, such as carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, zucchini, or even mushrooms. The creamy white sauce is made with flour, milk, cream, and processed cheese, creating a rich and comforting flavor. The pasta is topped with mozzarella cheese and baked until bubbly and golden brown, resulting in a delicious and visually appealing meal.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you are designing your house, or whenever you are getting some work done around the house, be very particular to give your drainage points for the washing machine. You need two drainage points: one for the inlet of water and one for the outlet of water. Giving the drainage points is not expensive at all, and it creates a much hassle-free decision later on.</p>
