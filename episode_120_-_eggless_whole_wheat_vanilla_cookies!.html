                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When building a house, it is important to consider the addition of a veranda or balcony. People like to have greens all around them, whether it's pots or hanging plants. A point that is often missed during construction is giving off a water point. Water points are necessary so that watering the plants is not an issue.</p>
