                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>The tip is the height of the steps that we give in a building. If you're going up a four- or five-story high building, and you're going up the steps, at times what people do is, to save a step, they'll make one floor six inches and the next floor six and a half inches. If someone is coming down the stairs quickly, the human body is so perceptive that if there is a 4-5 mm difference, the step is ruined and there is a chance of you stumbling down. Therefore, the riser height should always remain constant.</p>
