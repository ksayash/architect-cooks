                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These chocolate chip cookies are a classic treat that is sure to please both kids and adults alike.

Both variations are quick and easy to make, making them a great option for a last-minute dessert or snack. The recipe is also flexible, allowing you to use whole wheat flour for a healthier option.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>The tip of the day is related to the main gate of the apartment or the bungalow. Main gates are normally wide for big cars, SUVs, and sometimes mini trucks. The tip is to never keep the gate's two flaps equal. At times, pedestrians or two-wheelers have to come inside, so you don't need to open the entire gate.</p>
