                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These cookies are a healthy alternative to traditional cookies. They are made with whole wheat and banana, and contain no fat, oil, eggs, or sugar. This makes them a guilt-free snack that you can enjoy anytime. The bananas are pureed to give the cookies a running consistency. Rolled oats are used, but instant oats can also be used. The cookies are flavored with cinnamon and a pinch of salt. Chocolate chips are added for a touch of sweetness. The cookies are baked until golden brown. They are soft and crumbly when they come out of the oven, but they will firm up as they cool.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you are designing a house, the balcony's outlet drain should be connected to a rainwater pipe, duct, or sewage line. That makes day-to-day life much easier. This is important so that when you wash the balcony, the water doesn't fall on someone's head or in an open area outside.</p>
