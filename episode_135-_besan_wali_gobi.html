                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"Light is very important. A major problem comes with light in the kitchens. Kitchens normally, because houses are getting smaller, sizes are getting smaller, kitchens are small. Because of the small size of the kitchen, you have your window, where you have to put your gas, or you have to put storage counters above the slab, the window space is very less. So, I always give the tip that wherever your counters are, above or below, you give ribbon windows. Ribbon windows are thin horizontal kinds of windows, fixed glass, but at least you get light."</p>
