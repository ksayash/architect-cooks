                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Paneer Lababdar is a popular Indian dish that is known for its rich and flavorful gravy. It is a dish that is both tasty and fancy, but surprisingly easy to make. The dish is characterized by its unique grainy texture, which sets it apart from other paneer dishes like Paneer Makhani. This texture is achieved through the careful cooking of the onions and spices, which are then combined with tomato puree, cream, and cashew paste to create a rich and creamy sauce. The dish is finished with the addition of fresh paneer cubes, which are gently mixed into the sauce to absorb the flavors.</p>

* Oil for cooking (2-3 Tbsp)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. Heat oil in a pan. Add finely chopped onions and saute until golden brown.
2. Add grated ginger and garlic paste. Cook for about a minute.
3. Add all dry spices except garam masala.
4. Add curd and cook until the water dries.
5. Add tomato puree and cook until oil leaves the sides.

<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
* To prevent onions from over-browning and becoming bitter, add about 2 tablespoons of water while sauteing. This also helps to bring out the color of the onions.
* When adding the paneer, be gentle to avoid breaking the pieces.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>For master bedrooms, it is recommended to install a master switch that controls all the lights in the room, except for the bedside lamp and the air conditioner. This allows you to turn off all the lights in the room with a single switch, without having to get out of bed. This is especially useful if you have multiple lights in the room or if you are already settled in for the night.</p>
