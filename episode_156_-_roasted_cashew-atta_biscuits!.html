                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These cookies are a quick and easy treat that can be made with ingredients you likely already have in your pantry. The recipe uses whole wheat flour, making them a healthier alternative to traditional cookies. The roasted cashews add a nutty flavor and satisfying crunch. Ghee is used instead of butter, giving the cookies a rich and slightly different flavor profile. These cookies are perfect for a quick snack or a sweet treat with a cup of coffee or tea. They are also a great option for those looking for a healthier cookie recipe.</p>
