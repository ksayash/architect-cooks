                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe isn't a dish, but rather a method for preparing the dough for roti or paratha. It's a quick and easy way to prepare the dough, perfect for busy weeknights. The method involves mixing the flour and water with a spoon, letting it rest for 10 minutes, and then kneading it for just a minute. This results in a soft and pliable dough that's easy to work with. This method is especially useful when you don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen. It's also great for beginners who are just learning how to make roti or paratha.</p>

                    <p>"Use depressed C handles instead of regular ones. The benefit is that when you are working in the kitchen and you are quickly going from here to there, then never do your clothes get caught, nor do you get hurt. And since they run all through the width of the drawer or the almirah, whatever, so anywhere you pull it and quickly it opens and closes."</p>
