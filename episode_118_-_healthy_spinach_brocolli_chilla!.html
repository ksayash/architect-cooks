                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   1 cup chopped spinach
*   1 cup broccoli florets
*   1 cup besan (gram flour)
*   7-8 cloves of garlic
*   1 teaspoon grated ginger
*   1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves
*   2-3 green chilies
*   ½ teaspoon black pepper powder
*   ½ teaspoon garam masala powder
*   ½ teaspoon cumin seed powder

*   3-4 tablespoons water

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  Add broccoli and spinach leaves to a blender along with garlic, green chilies, and about 3-4 tablespoons of water. Blend to form a thick paste.

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>If you want to use concealed door closers, there are two types of door closers: a pelmet arm, which is a regular visible door closer, and a concealed door closer. Concealed door closers are very sleek and thin door closers. If you want to use concealed door closers, you have to plan for it from the beginning because you need a minimum thickness of the door to be 40mm. If your door is 30 or 35mm, you will not be able to use a concealed door closer.</p>
