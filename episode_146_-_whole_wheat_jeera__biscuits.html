                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Buildings are normally they go vertically high, but due to the height restrictions and people want to get the maximum floor area ratio, that is the maximum permissible built-up area according to the local bylaws, so we don't give height very much to floor to floor. As a result, at times the ceiling tends to be a little too low. For that, a trick is that whatever ceiling you paint, do not use a dark color for the ceiling. Ideally, paint it white. If you don't want white, then any color of the lightest possible shade. That way, visually, you'll get the ceiling a little high.</p>
