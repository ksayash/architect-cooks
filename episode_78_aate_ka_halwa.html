                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Aate ka Halwa is a traditional Indian dessert that is simple to make but rich in flavor. It is made with whole wheat flour, ghee, sugar, and water, and is often garnished with nuts. This dish is perfect for special occasions or as a comforting treat on a cold day. The key to making a good Aate ka Halwa is to roast the flour properly until it turns aromatic and golden brown. This gives the halwa a nutty flavor and a smooth texture. It is important to stir the mixture continuously to avoid forming lumps.</p>

                    <p>"Usually the height of the houses or the flats is about 10 feet and the beam depth is 2 feet. Which means the bottom of the beam is usually at 8 feet from the ground level. So we recommend to all our clients that we put the doors at the beam bottom." There are two benefits to this: it looks aesthetically elegant and it saves a lot of time in construction.</p>
