                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When we build a house or any building, we pay a lot of attention to the inside of our boundary, but what we miss is right outside the boundary. So, when you develop a house or complex, do take care that immediately outside the boundary, if space allows, which it normally does because the road and boundary have some space, start with some green trees plantation. So that by the time you move in, those trees have grown, and they are not only very aesthetic and they look very nice and green, but they also provide a lot of shade to you in the coming years.</p>
