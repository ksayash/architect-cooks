                    <p>If you are building a new home or retrofitting your electrical points, remember to use universal sockets. This is because any two-pin or three-pin plug can be used in the socket. Also, with the world becoming more global, it's easier to acquire gadgets from different parts of the world, and this will allow you to use them without any issues.</p>
