                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This whole wheat orange cake is a healthy and delicious treat that is perfect for any occasion. What makes this cake unique is that it uses pureed oranges, including the skin, instead of orange juice. This gives the cake a slightly bitter-sweet taste, similar to orange marmalade. If you don't like the bitter-sweet taste, you can peel the oranges before pureeing them. The orange variety used in this recipe is the Kinnow variety, but any orange will work. This cake is also very easy to make and can be ready in minutes. It doesn't need any fancy garnishing, but a simple dusting of caster sugar will make it look even more appealing.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Overhead cabinets are a must in kitchens because of the small size of modern kitchens. Separate stores are not normally in homes or apartments, so overhead cabinets are a place to store maximum things. When planning the depth of the overhead cabinets, the depth should be 12 inches. If your slab is 24 inches, the overhead cabinet should only be 1 foot deep.</p>
