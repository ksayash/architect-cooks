                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe teaches you how to make paneer from scratch at home. It uses only two ingredients: milk and lemon juice. The recipe is designed to be no waste, so the whey that is created during the process is saved and used in other dishes. The paneer itself is soft and creamy, and can be used in a variety of dishes. The recipe also includes tips on how to store the paneer for later use.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* 1 litre standard milk (4.5% fat)
* 3 Tbsp lemon juice (to be used as required)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. In a vessel, put about 1/4 cup water, then pour the milk and set to boil on high flame.
2. As soon as the milk comes to a boil, set flame to minimum and add 1 Tbsp of lemon juice while stirring well. The milk will start to curdle.
3. Judge the quantity of lemon juice to be added (till the whey separates totally). It is usually done in 1.5 to 2 Tbsp. Do not add extra lemon juice, or the paneer will not be as soft.
4. Once the paneer is separated, switch off the flame. Now strain through a strainer in which a cloth napkin has been placed.
5. Once strained, wash the paneer under running water. This will ensure that the sourness of the lemon gets removed and the paneer stays soft.
6. Now shape the paneer, wrap in the cloth, and keep it between two flat surfaces. Put some weight on top to compress the same.
7. Keep it as such for at least 2 hours. After this, the paneer can be cut into cubes and used immediately, or stored in a zip lock in the freezer for about 2 weeks.
8. You get about 170 to 180g of paneer from 1 litre of standard milk.
9. The whey can also be retained and used in place of vegetable stock, soup or as the base for making kadhi.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking tips:</strong>
* Normally when you boil milk, in whichever vessel you are boiling it, put at least 1/4 cup of water at the bottom and then add the milk. Otherwise, the milk will stick to the bottom and burn.
* Add lemon juice gradually. If you add too much lemon juice, the paneer will be hard.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>A very common thing that we overlook is the growth of unnecessary plants in the structure of the building. You will see that sometimes the ledges or the balconies or the terrace, if there are cracks and crevices where some soil has accumulated, sometimes plants grow. These should be carefully removed whenever seen, and care should be taken that they do not grow there again because if they are left like that, the roots can be really detrimental to the structure.</p>
