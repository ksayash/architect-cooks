                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Arbi Chaat is a traditional Indian dish that is both tasty and easy to make. It can be served as a side snack for the main course, or as an appetizer. Arbi, also known as taro root, is boiled, peeled, and cut into circles, then mixed with a variety of spices and herbs. The dish is seasoned with finely chopped onions, green chilies, black salt, roasted jeera powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, salt, imli paste, and lemon juice. Fresh green coriander is added for flavor and garnish. The combination of these ingredients creates a flavorful and refreshing chaat that is perfect for any occasion.</p>

                    <p>Always have some extra side tables in the drawing room or living room. You can even go in for a nesting table. Nesting tables can be a set of three, a set of five, or a set of two, whatever you find comfortable which goes with your decor. Because whenever you have guests and you want to serve something, these come in very handy.</p>
