                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   2.5 cups full cream milk
*   180-200 grams paneer, crumbled
*   3 Tbsp fresh cream
*   4 Tbsp sugar
*   2 Tbsp chopped almonds and pistachios
*   Ghee for greasing</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Make paneer from 1 liter milk (as shown in episode 7 of this series). Once the paneer is made, just strain and keep aside the crumbled paneer, do not set. (Alternatively, you can get 180g fresh paneer from the market and crumble it coarsely)</li>
<li>In the meantime, put the rest of the milk (2.5 cups), to boil in a heavy bottomed pan.</li>
<li>Grease a suitable dish with ghee and put aside.</li>
<li>Once the milk reduces to about half, add the fresh cream and crumbled paneer. Keep stirring, till it thickens and milk is almost absorbed.</li>
<li>At this stage, add the sugar and cook for a few more minutes, till you get the desired consistency.</li>
<li>Pour the hot mixture into the greased dish, pat at the top, garnish with chopped dry fruits and keep aside for at least 2 to 3 hours before serving. If you want to store in the fridge, cover with cling wrap so that it doesn't dry.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   If you prefer a sweeter dessert, increase the amount of sugar.
*   If you don't have fresh cream, you can use more milk.
*   If you want a harder Kalakand, cook for a few more minutes.
*   You can add a pinch of cardamom powder for flavoring.</p>

                    <p>"Balconies are the place where we normally dry the clothes after washing them. Invariably we have seen that the drying lines are in the balcony. There are two problems with this. One is aesthetically, it is not very good when you go out and want to use the balcony. Secondly, they are a visual obstruction. We recommend to our clients that at the height of the railing, outside the railing on both sides, we extend two hooks. Between those hooks, we tie the drying lines parallel to one another. This way, when you put the clothes out to dry, the level of the clothes is the level of the railing."</p>
