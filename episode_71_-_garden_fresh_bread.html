                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This is a very healthy bread recipe that is made with whole wheat. It's also called the garden fresh whole wheat bread because it contains a lot of greens and flavors. The bread is so flavorful that you don't need anything else to go with it. Just add a little butter and it's ready to eat. It's great for breakfast with a cup of coffee or tea. The tomatoes are deseeded and the juice is removed so that the skin is firm.</p>
