                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Sago/Tapioca pearls/Sabudana: ¼ cup (raw) 
* Lemon juice: 1 tsp 
* Potatoes: 4 medium (boiled and mashed) 
* Red chili powder: ½ tsp
* Amchoor powder: ½ tsp 
* Green chilies: 2-3 (finely chopped) 
* Coriander: 2 Tbsp (finely chopped) 
* Salt: to taste
* Oil: for frying</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. Wash the sabudana at least 3 times.
2. Soak it for 2 to 3 hours, drain and rest for another couple of hours with 2 Tbsp water and 1 tsp lemon juice sprinkled on top. 
3. Add all the ingredients to the mashed potatoes and mix well with soft hands. 
4. Grease palms and shape into Tikka.
5. Deep fry in medium hot oil till golden brown.

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When furnishing a living room or drawing room, it's important to avoid monotony. Instead of using matching three-seater, two-seater, and one-seater sofas, try using assorted pieces. For example, pair a two-seater sofa with a wing chair or a standalone chair. This breaks the monotony and adds warmth to the room.</p>
