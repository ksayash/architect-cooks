                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These muffins are a delightful treat that appeals to all ages. The combination of banana and walnut creates a comforting and satisfying flavor profile. What sets these muffins apart is the use of whole wheat flour, making them a healthier option.

The addition of cinnamon powder enhances the warmth and aroma, making them perfect for breakfast or a snack. These muffins are easy to serve and enjoy, making them a go-to dessert for any occasion.</p>

                    <p>Where possible, go in for LED lights. The fixture initially is more expensive than the regular CFLs or the incandescent bulbs or the tube lights, but its life is many times more than these. Plus, there is a lot of saving of electricity, and it is environment-friendly.</p>
