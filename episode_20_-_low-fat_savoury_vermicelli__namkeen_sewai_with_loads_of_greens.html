<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Roast the vermicelli in a pan until golden.</li>
<li>In a pan, add water to the roasted vermicelli. Bring it to a boil and turn the flame to minimum. Add a pinch of salt and 1 tsp of oil. Let it cook until the water almost evaporates. Stir a bit and keep aside.</li>
<li>In another pan/kadai, add the oil. Add the peanuts. Cook until they start to crackle. Add the daals, mustard seeds, red chilies, green chilies, ginger, and curry leaves. Saute for about a minute.</li>
<li>Add the onion and potatoes. Cook for a couple of minutes, until the potato is done.</li>
<li>Add all the vegetables, except the capsicum. Stir on high flame for a minute. Add the salt and red chili powder.</li>
<li>Now add the boiled vermicelli and toss well. Add the lemon juice and capsicum, and mix well.</li>
<li>Serve hot, garnished with green coriander.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cooking tips:</strong>
*   If using frozen green peas, thaw them slightly in the microwave before adding them to the dish.
*   If using fresh green peas, parboil them before adding them to the dish.
*   Adjust the amount of red chili powder to taste.
*   Do not overcook the vegetables, as they should retain their color and crunch.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"Never put the trap in the bathing area directly under the shower or the tap. Always put it on one side, one corner. The slope of the bathing area can be such that the water goes directly into the trap, but it should never be under the tap." This is important because if the trap is directly under the tap, it can easily become clogged with hair and other debris. This can lead to water backing up in the shower or tub, which can be a nuisance.</p>
