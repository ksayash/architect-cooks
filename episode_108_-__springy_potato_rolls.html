                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These springy potato rolls are a delicious and visually appealing snack that is sure to be a hit with both kids and adults. This appetizer is easy to make with ingredients that are commonly found in most homes. The rolls are made with a simple dough that is stuffed with a flavorful potato mixture. The dough is then rolled into an elongated disc, cut into strips, and rolled up to create a spring-like shape. The rolls are then fried until golden brown and crispy. These rolls are perfect for a quick snack, a party appetizer, or even a light meal. Feel free to experiment with the flavors by adding green chilies, onion, or other spices to the potato filling.</p>
