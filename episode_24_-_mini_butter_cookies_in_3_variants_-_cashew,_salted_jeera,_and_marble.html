                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   50g soft butter
*   65g (1/2 cup) all-purpose flour
*   25g (3 Tbsp) caster sugar
*   1/2 tsp roasted cumin seeds
*   Pinch of salt
*   1 tsp cocoa powder
*   1 tsp coarsely ground cashews</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a mixing bowl, add the butter and sugar. Whisk for a minute, until fluffy.</li>
<li>Add the flour. Mix well with a fork until it comes together. Use your hands to bind the dough (do not knead).</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 3 parts.</li>
<li>In the first part, add jeera and salt. Mix well. Shape into a cuboid, wrap it in a piece of butter paper, and put aside.</li>
<li>In the second part, add the cashews and repeat the process.</li>
<li>Divide the third part into two. Add the cocoa powder to one part and mix. Now shape both parts together into a cube as directed in the video.</li>
<li>Put the 3 doughs in the fridge for about 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven on bake mode to 170 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Cut the cookies into the desired shape and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
<li>Serve once cool and crunchy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   Do not overcook the cookies. The base should be lightly browned, and the top should remain whitish.
*   If the base of the cookies starts to brown too quickly, transfer them to another plate to prevent overcooking.
*   Let the cookies cool completely before serving to allow them to become crunchy.</p>
