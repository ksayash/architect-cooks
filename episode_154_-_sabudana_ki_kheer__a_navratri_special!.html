                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Sabudana Kheer is a traditional Indian dessert, also known as tapioca pudding. It is a popular dessert, especially during fasting periods like Navratri. Sabudana is mainly starch, so it provides a quick energy boost, which is beneficial during fasting when the body feels weak. This recipe is a quick version, using pre-soaked sabudana to reduce cooking time. The addition of saffron, cardamom, and various nuts enhances the flavor and texture, making it a creamy and delicious treat. It can be served hot or chilled, depending on preference.</p>

                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   ¼ cup raw sabudana (medium size)
*   2 cups full cream milk
*   2 Tbsp fresh cream
*   3-4 Tbsp sugar
*   4-5 saffron strands
*   8-10 raisins
*   2 Tbsp roasted cashews
*   2 Tbsp chopped almonds
*   2 green cardamoms (slightly crushed)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  Rinse the sabudana 4-5 times until the water is clear.
2.  Soak the sabudana in water for a couple of hours.
3.  Drain the water and keep the sabudana aside for 3-4 hours.
4.  In a kadai (wok), bring the milk to a boil.
5.  Add the soaked sabudana and cook until it becomes transparent.
6.  Add the saffron, raisins, and cashews.

<p><strong>Cooking Tip:</strong> If using raw sabudana, add it to the milk at the beginning and cook along with the milk. Remember to scrape the sides of the pan to incorporate the cream that settles there, enhancing the flavor.</p>

                    <p>"Be very careful that you regularly get pest control termite control done because termite is one menace that quietly comes, but once it enters the house, it's very difficult to get rid of them. And, under the hood, it does so much damage by the time it gets visible to the naked eye, then the damage has been done." This is important because termites can cause significant structural damage to a building before their presence is even noticed. Regular pest control helps prevent this damage.</p>
