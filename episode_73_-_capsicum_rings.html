                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Capsicum rings are a simple yet flavorful dish that can be prepared quickly. This recipe features a savory potato filling stuffed into crisp capsicum rings, creating a delightful combination of textures and tastes. The potato filling is seasoned with a blend of spices, including salt, red chili powder, dry mango powder, and coriander powder, along with chopped onion, coriander, grated ginger, and green chilies. The capsicum rings are shallow-fried until golden brown, resulting in a satisfying crunch. This dish is perfect as an evening snack or as a side dish with dal, paratha, or roti. The use of boiled potatoes ensures that the dish doesn't absorb too much oil during frying, making it a healthier option.</p>

                    <p>"When giving a house railing, we normally prefer to give wood because wood gives us warmth. If we use metallic or glass railings, it becomes a little informal. If it's an office building or a commercial complex, glass, steel, and metal railings are fine. But in the house, we normally advise to use wood."</p>
