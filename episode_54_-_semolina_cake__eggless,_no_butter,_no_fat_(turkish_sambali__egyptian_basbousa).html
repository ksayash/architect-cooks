                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This semolina cake, also known as Sambali or Revani, is a Middle Eastern dessert that is easy to make and low in fat. This recipe is a Turkish variation of the Egyptian Basbousa. It is a quick and easy dessert that is perfect for any occasion. The cake is made with semolina, milk, sugar, and baking soda, and is garnished with almonds. The cake is baked until golden brown, and then soaked in a simple syrup made with sugar, water, rose water, and lemon juice. The cake is best served after it has soaked in the syrup for at least 4 to 5 hours.</p>
