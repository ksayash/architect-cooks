                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Living rooms are one area where wall or ceiling lights are not recommended. Instead, use table or floor lamps. This is a personal choice, but it is important to have the option of putting in extra floor lamps or table lamps. This allows for flexibility in lighting and can help to create a more inviting atmosphere.</p>
