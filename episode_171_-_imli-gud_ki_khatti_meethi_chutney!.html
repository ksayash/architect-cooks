                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This chutney is a quick and easy way to add a lot of flavor to any dish. It's a sweet and tangy dip that can be made in just a few minutes. The combination of tamarind and jaggery creates a unique flavor profile that is both sweet and sour. The spices add a touch of warmth and complexity to the chutney. This chutney is a great way to add a little something extra to your meal. It can be used as a dip for snacks, a condiment for sandwiches, or a sauce for grilled meats. It's also a great way to use up leftover tamarind paste.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>½ cup Imli paste</li>
<li>½ cup Gud/jaggery</li>
<li>1 tsp roasted jeera powder</li>
<li>½ tsp Kala namak</li>
<li>1 tsp Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a pan, cook together the Imli paste and jaggery.</li>
<li>Once the gud melts, add all the spices.</li>
<li>Cook till desired consistency is attained.</li>
<li>Switch flame off and allow to cool.</li>
<li>Store in an airtight bottle in the fridge.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When cooking, keep in mind that the final consistency should be a level less than what you want, because the chutney will get thicker as it cools.</li>
<li>If the chutney gets too thick, add one or two tablespoons of water and recook it. Do not add raw water, as this will cause the chutney to spoil.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>"Normally we prefer that external walls we give services. Services, we mean toilets and kitchens, we normally like to give it on the external walls of a house or an apartment, so that it's direct outside sunlight or ventilation." This is important because it allows for natural light and ventilation in these areas. However, due to space or design constraints, internal services must be used. In this case, a duct is used to provide ventilation.</p>
