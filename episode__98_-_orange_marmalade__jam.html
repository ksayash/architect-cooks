                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a two-in-one, allowing you to make either orange jam or orange marmalade. It's a versatile accessory to food, perfect for breakfast or an evening snack. Spread it on parathas, bread, or toast for a delightful treat. It's a favorite among children and adults alike. The recipe uses orange puree, along with the juice and fibers, to create a rich flavor. For an extra touch, cloves are added to give it a slightly spicy flavor. The marmalade version includes orange zest for a welcome bitterness.</p>

                    <p>When you come to an architect's office to get a design done, maybe it's for an office building or a commercial complex, or a residence, or your own house, or a flat complex, whatever it is, you know, whatever changes you want, or you've told us your requirements, we've given you a first sketch. Do it on paper. It's easier to rub on paper rather than to hammer on the ground.</p>
