                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This mango jam is a seasonal treat that can be enjoyed year-round. It is made without any preservatives or artificial colors, making it a healthy and delicious option for the whole family. The jam is quick and easy to make, and it can be stored in the fridge for up to six to eight months. The key to a good mango jam is to use ripe, non-fibrous mangoes. The sugar and lemon juice act as natural preservatives, and the lemon juice also helps to produce pectin, which sets the jam. This jam is perfect on toast, crackers, or as a filling for pastries.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   1.5 cups mango pulp (ripe mangoes without strands)
*   1/2 cup sugar
*   1 Tbsp lemon juice</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  In a pan or kadai, add the mango puree along with the sugar.
2.  Cook on medium flame, stirring continuously.
3.  After about 5 minutes, add the lemon juice while still stirring.
4.  In about 10 to 12 minutes, the mixture will turn thick and glossy.
5.  When the consistency is still a little thinner than we require finally, put off the flame.
6.  Transfer to a clean bottle while hot.
7.  Put lid on only once totally cool.
8.  Store in the fridge. If cooked and stored correctly, it can easily last for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong>
*   Even if the mango is sweet, do not lessen the quantity of sugar because here sugar and lemon juice is what acts as the preservative and it also produces pectin in the jam, which sets your jam.
*   The bottle should be well sterilized, but absolutely dry.
*   Do not close the bottle when the jam is even warm.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Normally we have seen that, like, the wall, on top of the wall, people just stick the skirting. As a result, what happens is that whatever your flooring is, whether it is marble, whether it is granite, whether it is a tile, whatever the width of that flooring, that much width skirting of your wall comes out. It has two disadvantages. One is when you put your furniture, those spaces become very odd spaces. And the second disadvantage is that that projected surface, half inch, one inch, that is always a place where dirt and dust collects a lot. So just to avoid that, what we recommend is that where our wall comes and then the skirting comes, to wall, you chisel it and then you put the skirting so that the level of the wall and the skirting is flushed.</p>
