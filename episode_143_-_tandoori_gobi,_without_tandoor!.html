                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Tandoori Gobi is a universally loved dish that can be prepared in a variety of ways. This recipe is a dry preparation that is both crunchy and flavorful. The cauliflower is cut into large florets to maintain its texture during cooking. The marinade is made with thick curd, roasted besan, and a blend of spices. The addition of mustard oil to the marinade gives the dish a unique zing. The cauliflower is cooked on a medium flame until golden brown on both sides. Finally, the dish is smoked with charcoal to give it a tandoori flavor.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   Use thick curd for the marinade. If you don't have thick curd, you can strain regular curd for 30 minutes to remove excess water.
*   Cut the cauliflower into large florets to maintain its texture during cooking.
*   Use mustard oil in the marinade for a unique zing.
*   Cook the cauliflower on a low to medium flame until golden brown on both sides.
*   If your pan is small or you have a lot of cauliflower, cook it in batches.
*   Rotate the pan to ensure even cooking.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>In kitchen design, it is recommended to give a toe space under the working platform. This is a depression where, while you are working, it's easier to keep your foot. Especially if you have narrow kitchens, along the toe space, if you give a strip lighting, the narrow kitchens' width is visually more.</p>
