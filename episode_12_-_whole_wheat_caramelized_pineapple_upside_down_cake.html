                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This caramelized upside-down pineapple cake is a unique dessert that is made with whole wheat flour. The cake is made with fresh pineapple, but canned pineapple can be used if fresh is out of season. The cake is baked upside down, so the caramelized pineapple forms the top layer. The cake is moist and flavorful, and the caramelized pineapple adds a touch of sweetness and tanginess. The cinnamon powder adds a warm and comforting flavor. This cake is perfect for a tea-time party or as a dessert after dinner. It is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When deciding between a hob and a gas stove, consider that a gas stove offers more flexibility. If you want to change your gas stove, you can just remove the old one and attach a new one. However, if you have a hob, you are restricted to replacing it with a hob of the same size.</p>
