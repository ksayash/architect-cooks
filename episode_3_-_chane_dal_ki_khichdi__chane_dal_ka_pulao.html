                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Chane Daal ki Khichdi, or Chane ki Daal ka Pulao, is a simple yet traditional recipe that has been enjoyed for generations. This dish, which is more of a pulao than a khichdi, is a staple in many households and is often prepared during special occasions like Rakhi and Bhai Dooj. The combination of rice and chana dal, infused with aromatic spices, creates a hearty and flavorful meal. A unique twist to this recipe is the use of a "mirchi ki potli," a muslin cloth filled with red chili powder and salt, which adds a subtle heat and depth of flavor without making the entire dish spicy. This allows everyone to enjoy the pulao, with the option to add the chili paste as an accompaniment.</p>

                    <p>"Nowadays, it's the era of sustainability. We all believe that things which are getting scarce should not be used much. As an architect, the biggest challenge we face is doors in the house. Doors and door frames are usually made of wood. Rubberwood is a very good alternative to normal wood. Rubberwood's growth rate is very fast. In five years, a rubber tree grows to its full life to be used as timber."</p>
