                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   1 cup + 1 Tbsp whole wheat flour (aata)
*   1 tsp baking powder
*   1 tsp baking soda
*   Pinch of salt
*   ¾ cup cape gooseberry-banana puree (12-15 cape gooseberries + 1 banana)
*   ¾ cup sugar
*   ¼ cup refined oil
*   ½ cup milk
*   1 tsp lemon juice
*   ½ tsp vanilla essence
*   Cape gooseberry halves for decoration</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius on bake mode.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine milk, sugar, oil, vanilla essence, fruit puree, and lemon juice. Mix well.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix flour with salt, baking powder, and baking soda.</li>
<li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Gently fold. Adjust the consistency by adding milk if required.</li>
<li>Garnish with cape gooseberry halves.</li>
<li>Bake for 35-40 minutes until done.</li>
<li>Once cool, demold, slice, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong>
*   Use any flavorless and odorless oil. Sunflower oil is a good option.
*   Granulated sugar can be used. It will melt within 3-5 minutes of mixing.
*   Do not overmix the batter.
*   After mixing, do not let the batter sit. The baking soda will start to react as soon as it comes into contact with the lemon juice and milk.
*   Run a butter knife along the edges of the cake while it is still warm to help it release from the pan.
*   Allow the cake to cool for at least 15 minutes before cutting. Cutting it too soon will cause it to be too crumbly.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When designing a house or building, keep the future in mind. Even if you only need a certain number of floors now, consider adding one or two additional floors to the foundation design, keeping in mind local bylaws and height restrictions. This may be a little more expensive upfront, but it provides the freedom to add floors later without worrying about the structure.</p>
