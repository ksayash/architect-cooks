                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Veg Hot and Sour Soup is a universally loved soup that is loaded with greens and flavors. It is both hot, meaning spicy, and sour, meaning tangy. This soup is a quick and easy recipe that can be made in under 10 minutes if the vegetables are already chopped. The vegetables are not cooked much, so they remain crunchy. This soup is a great way to get your greens in, and it is perfect for a cold day.</p>

                    <p>The architectural tip is about the use of smart lights in a house to create certain moods. Smart lights are not just convenient because you can control them from your phone or tablet from any part of the house or from anywhere. If you have a certain kind of theme for any evening and you want to set a mood, they come very handy.</p>
