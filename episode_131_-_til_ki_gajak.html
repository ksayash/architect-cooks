                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Til ki gachak is a popular Indian snack, especially during the winter months. It is a simple yet delicious treat made with sesame seeds and jaggery. The combination of sesame seeds and jaggery makes it a healthy and warming snack, perfect for cold weather. The sesame seeds provide essential nutrients, while the jaggery adds a natural sweetness. The addition of fennel seeds is optional, but it adds a unique flavor to the gachak. The gachak is easy to make and requires minimal ingredients, making it a convenient snack to prepare at home. It can be stored in an airtight container for several days, making it a great option for meal prepping.</p>

5.  Shape the mixture into a thin bar using a rolling pin.

                    <p>When finishing a house, it's common to lay floor tiles. However, this can lead to problems during painting, as paint can easily spill and damage the tiles. To prevent this, either cover the tiles with a thick layer of plaster of Paris or use self-adhesive plastic films. These protective measures ensure that the tiles remain as good as new during the final finishing stages.</p>
