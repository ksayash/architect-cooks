                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Vegetable au gratin is a French dish that has become synonymous with Indian cuisine. It is a universally loved dish that is a staple in many Indian menus. This recipe is a one-pot dish that saves a lot of time. The vegetables are not parboiled, but rather cooked with the butter mixture. The recipe is also customizable, as you can use any vegetables of your choice. The dish is baked until the cheese layer has browned, and the result is a creamy, gooey, and delicious vegetable au gratin.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>After the structure of the house is complete and the walls have come up, plaster the walls. Then, instead of applying plaster of Paris, use wall putty. Wall putty dries quickly, and it gives a very smooth surface on the wall. This results in a very smooth surface on the wall, and the paint has a shine.</p>
