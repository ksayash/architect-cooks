                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These bread and potato cutlets are a healthy alternative to traditional cutlets, which are often deep-fried. This recipe uses bread and potatoes as the base, and the cutlets are shallow-fried in a pan, minimizing the amount of oil used. The recipe is a great option for those who are health-conscious but still want to enjoy a tasty snack. The cutlets are also versatile and can be served as an evening snack or a morning breakfast. The recipe is easy to customize to your liking by adjusting the spices and adding other vegetables.</p>

<li>Once all the cutlets are shaped, put a shallow pan on the flame.</li>
<li>Grease with 1 tbsp of oil.</li>
<li>Once hot, put the cutlets.</li>
<li>Shallow fry them on both sides till crispy brown.</li>

<p><strong>Cooking tip:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drain the potatoes after boiling to prevent them from becoming too wet.</li>
<li>Be careful not to overfill the bread with the potato mixture, as this can make the cutlets difficult to shape.</li>
<li>Do not move the cutlets immediately after placing them in the pan. Allow the bread to cook a little before flipping.</li>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"Before, what would happen is the houses would have a separate store with the kitchen, which was called a Bhandar Ghar. Where we would store our things that came from the market, we would store them. But today, slowly the sizes of the houses are getting smaller. They have started living in apartments and space has become very, very scarce." Therefore, when designing a kitchen, it is important to include a storage corner in addition to cabinets. This will make your life much simpler.</p>
