                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a guilt-free snack that can be enjoyed with tea or coffee. It's a healthier alternative to deep-fried snacks, offering a satisfying crunch without the added oil. Roasting the peanuts in the oven ensures an even cook, preventing some from burning while others remain undercooked. The small amount of oil used helps the salt stick to the peanuts, creating a delicious glaze. This method is also convenient, as you can leave the peanuts to roast while attending to other tasks. The result is a batch of perfectly roasted, flavorful peanuts that are ready to be enjoyed anytime.</p>

                    <p>When designing a kitchen platform, do not forget to give the toe space. If you don't give the toe space, then every time that you work, you'll get a tocker. The toe space is a little depression in the cabinet itself, where when you stand, your toes go a little inside.</p>
