                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Murmure Ladoo is a traditional Indian snack that is both simple and satisfying. Made with just two main ingredients, puffed rice and jaggery, it's a quick and healthy treat that requires no sugar, ghee, or oil. This recipe is perfect for those moments when you crave something sweet but want to avoid processed ingredients. The combination of the light, airy puffed rice with the rich, caramel-like flavor of jaggery creates a delightful texture and taste. These laddoos are not only a delicious snack but also a nostalgic reminder of traditional Indian sweets. They are easy to make and can be enjoyed as a dessert, snack, or a quick energy boost.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   30g puffed rice (murmure/moodi)
*   45g jaggery, grated or crushed
*   Cold water</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a pan or kadai, add the grated or crushed jaggery.</li>
<li>Cook on medium heat until the jaggery starts to melt, then reduce the heat to low.</li>
<li>Continue cooking until the jaggery becomes frothy.</li>
<li>To test if the jaggery is cooked, drop a small amount into a bowl of cold water. If it solidifies and becomes brittle, it's ready.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and add the puffed rice to the pan.</li>
<li>Mix well, ensuring the puffed rice is evenly coated with the melted jaggery.</li>
<li>Wet your palms with cold water to prevent sticking and burning.</li>
<li>Take a small amount of the mixture and shape it into balls (laddoos) of the desired size.</li>
<li>Place the laddoos on a plate to cool.</li>
<li>Once cooled, store in an airtight container.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   Use cold water to wet your palms when shaping the laddoos to prevent burning.
*   Adjust the amount of jaggery according to your sweetness preference.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>A lot of my clients ask whether they need to have blackout lining behind the curtain. My tip is that the lining is a very useful thing to cut out light, but then you should decide which areas of the house you really want the blackout lining curtains to be in. It definitely adds expense and heavy, so the tracks you use have to be better quality. So the private areas of the house like the bedroom, where you really want where you are sleeping, you don't want light, there you should definitely give blackout.</p>
