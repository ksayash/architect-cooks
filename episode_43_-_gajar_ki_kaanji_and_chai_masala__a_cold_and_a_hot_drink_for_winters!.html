                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Kaanji is a popular drink in Punjab, India, especially in the winter months. It is known for its tangy flavor and beautiful color. Traditionally, it is made with black carrots, which are only available for a short time. This recipe uses red carrots and beetroot as a substitute. The chai masala is a blend of spices that are known for their immunity-boosting properties. It is a perfect way to warm up on a cold day. The spices can be adjusted to your liking. The chai masala is a great addition to any tea lover's collection.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When designing a house or a flat, it is important to provide at least two to three call bell ringers in all the crucial places in the house. One should be in the central lobby or foyer, or the dining area. Another should be in a bedroom where you spend a lot of time, or on the terrace. This is essential, otherwise the call bell may not be heard.</p>
