                    <p>Many people ask whether they need to give the sheer curtain or not. The best judge is you because your house is where your windows face. If your house is on a busy street or if there is a tall apartment building nearby, then you need the sheer curtain. If your house has a vast open space or your boundary wall is far from the road, then the sheer is not needed.</p>
