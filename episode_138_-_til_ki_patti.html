                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These transparent sesame patties are a unique and delicious treat that will impress your friends and family. Made with just two ingredients, sesame seeds and sugar, these patties are surprisingly easy to make. The key to their transparency is to roll them out very thinly while the caramel is still hot. The result is a delicate, crispy, and sweet treat that is perfect for snacking or as a garnish for desserts. The patties are so thin that they almost melt in your mouth, and the sesame seeds add a nutty flavor that is simply irresistible.</p>

*   It is better to make the caramelized sugar in small batches since it needs to be hot.
*   If you caramelize the sugar too darkly, the patties will taste bitter.</p>

                    <p>When building a house in places where the water table is very high, you will encounter water when digging the foundation. A simple solution is to dig a deeper pit next to the foundation. The water pressure will cause the water to go into the deeper pit, allowing the foundation to dry.</p>
