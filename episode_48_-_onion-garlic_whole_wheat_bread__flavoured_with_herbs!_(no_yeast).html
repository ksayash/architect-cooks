                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is for a whole wheat masala bread that is made without yeast, kneading, or proofing. It's an instant bread that is flavored with onion, garlic, and herbs. The bread is made with whole wheat flour, which gives it a hearty and nutritious base. The addition of caramelized onion and roasted garlic adds a savory depth of flavor, while mixed herbs and red chili flakes provide a touch of spice. Sesame seeds are sprinkled on top for a nutty crunch and visual appeal. The bread is brushed with butter after baking to keep it from drying out. This bread is perfect for a quick and easy snack or as a side to a meal.</p>

                    <p>When using sanitary fixtures in your bathrooms, such as taps, WCs, commodes, or shower heads, use water-conserving models. Water is becoming a fast-depleting resource, and we need to conserve it. Using water-saving fixtures is a way to give back to Mother Nature.</p>
