                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is for a delicious homemade pineapple jam, made without preservatives or artificial colors. It's a simple recipe that uses only three ingredients, and it can be made in just a few minutes. The jam is made with fresh pineapple, which is pureed and then cooked with sugar and lemon juice. The lemon juice helps to preserve the jam and gives it a bright, tangy flavor. The jam is best made when fresh pineapple is readily available in the market. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two to three months. The jam is perfect for spreading on toast, paratha, or using in cakes and desserts.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Pineapple puree: 1 cup
* Sugar: 1/2 cup + 1 Tbsp
* Lemon juice: 1 Tbsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. In a pan/kadai, take the pineapple puree and sugar. Cook together on medium flame, till sugar melts and the mixture thickens.
2. The final consistency should be a little thinner than that required finally.
3. Now, put the flame off. Add the lemon juice and mix well.
4. Pour hot, in a clean sterilized glass bottle. Do not put the lid on, till it cools down to room temperature.
5. If stored in the fridge in the correct way, it stays fresh for upto a couple of months.</p>
<p><em>Cooking tip: To coarsely grind the pineapple, don't run the blender continuously. Instead, turn the blender on and off to achieve a coarse texture.</em></p>

                    <p>When you take a sink, try to take a sink with two bowls. Whether two equal-sized bowls or a bigger bowl and a smaller bowl, if size permits. If you have four feet of space, try to take a two-bowl sink. It helps in many ways.</p>
