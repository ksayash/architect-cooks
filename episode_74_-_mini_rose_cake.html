                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When building a new residence or any construction, it's essential to consider the location and orientation of the house. Understanding the local climate, including the wind direction and sun exposure, is crucial. For example, if easterly winds are prevalent, orienting windows east-west can ensure the house remains well-ventilated. Paying attention to these factors from the beginning can greatly improve the comfort and sustainability of the building.</p>
