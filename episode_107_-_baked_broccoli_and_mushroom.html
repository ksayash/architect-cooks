                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This dish is a quick and easy way to get your vegetables in. It's a great way to use up leftover broccoli and mushrooms. The white sauce is simple to make and adds a creamy richness to the dish. The cheese on top melts and bubbles, creating a golden brown crust. This dish is perfect for a weeknight meal or a potluck. Serve it with garlic toast or a side of paratha for a complete meal.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (lightly roasted)
*   1 ⅓ cups milk (at room temperature)
*   1 small onion (finely chopped)
*   2 cups broccoli (coarsely chopped)
*   1 cup mushrooms (cut into quarters)
*   2 Tbsp butter
*   1 Tbsp oil
*   1 cheese cube (grated)
*   2 cheese slices
*   Salt to taste
*   1 tsp black pepper
*   ½ tsp sugar</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius on bake mode.
2.  Whisk together the roasted flour and milk so that there are no lumps.
3.  In a pan, add oil and butter and saute the onions until translucent.
4.  Add the vegetables, salt, and half the pepper. Mix well and stir on low flame for 3 to 4 minutes until the vegetables are a little soft.
5.  In another pan, pour the milk mixture and bring to a simmer.
6.  Add the grated cheese, sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
7.  Pour the white sauce into the vegetables, mix well, and switch off the flame.
8.  Pour the vegetable mixture into a baking dish.
9.  Top with the cheese slices.
10. Bake for 25 to 40 minutes, until you get a golden brown top.
11. Serve hot with garlic toast on the side.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   Roast the flour ahead of time to save time.
*   Don't add all the milk at once to the flour, otherwise, it can be difficult to make a smooth paste.
*   If you want softer vegetables, pre-cook them a little longer.</p>

                    <p>When finishing a house, keep a box of disposable gloves handy. When doing any work near the walls, have the workers wear gloves. This will save you a lot of headaches later where you have to keep cleaning all the smudges on the walls and the ceilings.</p>
