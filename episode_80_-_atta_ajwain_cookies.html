                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These cookies are a quick and easy treat that you can make at home with just a few ingredients. The star of the show is ajwain, also known as carom seeds, which gives the cookies a unique and savory flavor. They are made with whole wheat flour, making them a healthier option than traditional cookies. The cookies are also lightly sweetened with castor sugar, making them perfect for those who prefer a less sweet treat. They are baked until golden brown and crispy, making them a satisfying snack that you can enjoy any time of day. These cookies are so good that you'll never want to buy them from the store again!</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   50g butter
*   2.5 Tbsp castor sugar
*   1/2 cup whole wheat flour
*   1/2 tsp ajwain
*   A pinch of salt</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a bowl, whisk together soft butter and castor sugar for a couple of minutes, until fluffy.</li>
<li>Add the whole wheat flour, salt, and ajwain and mix well with a fork.</li>
<li>Bring the dough together with your hands.</li>
<li>Shape into cuboids, and chill in the fridge for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the OTG to 160 degrees Celsius on bake mode.</li>
<li>Cut into thin rectangles and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
<li>Let cool before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the butter is soft before whisking it with the sugar.</li>
<li>If you prefer a sweeter cookie, you can increase the amount of castor sugar to 3-3.5 Tbsp.</li>
<li>If you are using unsalted butter, add a pinch or two of salt to the dough.</li>
<li>When placing the cookies on the baking sheet, leave a little space between them as they will expand slightly during baking.</li>
<li>The cookies are a little soft when they come out of the oven, so let them cool down for 10-15 minutes before eating.</li>
</ul>

                    <p>"I've heard many people say that a kitchen air conditioner should not be installed. Well, I beg to differ. I am very fond of cooking, I like to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, but that having been said, I also feel very hot at times, you know, and I sweat a lot. So then, you know, it's no fun if you are uncomfortable. So my advice is that if you personally cook and if you stay in a warm place, you must have an air conditioner in the kitchen."</p>
