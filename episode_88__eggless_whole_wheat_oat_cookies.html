                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When painting a new house, you should never apply the paint directly to the wall putty. Instead, you should apply a coat of primer first. The primer will create an even surface and reduce the absorption of paint. As a result, the consumption of paint to paint the house will lessen drastically.</p>
