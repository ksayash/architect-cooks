                    <p>"We should give wall-hung WCs if possible. Wall-hung commodes are those that hang from the wall. One, because nowadays our apartments or homes also have space constraints, so toilet sizes are normally small. If you are giving wall-hung WCs, then their size, what they jut out from the wall, is very less. As a result, you gain space. And second is because they are above the floor, so your floor always gets cleaned."</p>
