                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>During the construction of a house, a precaution that you must take is to ensure that wherever cement is used, you do not proceed without curing that cement work for at least eight to ten days. Curing means that wherever cement work is done, you have to keep it wet and moist for at least eight to ten days. That is how the cement gains its strength. If you rush, you may save a couple of weeks, but in the long run, you'll have to pay a heavy price.</p>
