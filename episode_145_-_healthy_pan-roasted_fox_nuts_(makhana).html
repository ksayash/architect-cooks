                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is for a healthy snack that can be made at home. It is a great alternative to chips or other unhealthy snacks. The recipe is simple and easy to follow, and it only requires a few ingredients. The makhana, or fox nuts, are very light weight, making them a great snack for those who are watching their weight. The ghee adds a nice flavor to the makhana, but any flavorless oil can be used as a substitute. The makhana can be seasoned with salt, pepper, or any other spice of your choice. This is a great snack to have on hand when you are feeling hungry between meals.</p>

                    <p>Nowadays, modern gadgets are all the rage. In the same way, new fixtures have come into our toilets. For those shower panels with water jets and rain showers, the water pressure has to be very good. The solution to that is putting pressure pumps for the water. But the nuisance is that the pressure pumps are very loud. The solution is that wherever you are keeping the pressure pump, keep it on a slightly raised surface and that surface should be soundproof.</p>
