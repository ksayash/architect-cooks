                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When constructing a house or flat, make provision for an inverter in the electrical panel itself. Even if you stay in a place where power cuts are not frequent, this is a simple provision to make if you do it at the correct time. If you have to do it later, it is a lot of hassle. If you make the provision from the beginning, you can plug in your inverter at any desired time and you are good to go.</p>
