                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a twist on a normally not-very-loved vegetable, lauki, or bottle gourd. This recipe is called Shahi Lauki, and it is so delicious that even children will love it. This recipe is made without onion or garlic, so it is perfect for Navratri. The lauki is shallow fried before being added to the gravy, which gives it a unique texture. The gravy is made with curd and malai, which gives it a rich and creamy flavor. The addition of whole spices and ground spices makes this dish flavorful and aromatic.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   Lauki: 350-400g (tender, without seeds)
*   Cumin seeds: ½ tsp
*   Hing: a pinch
*   Green chili-ginger paste: 1 tsp
*   Bay leaf: 1
*   Black cardamom: 2
*   Cinnamon: 1 stick
*   Cloves: 4-5
*   Kashmiri red chili powder: 1 tsp
*   Turmeric: ¼ tsp
*   Coriander powder: 2 tsp
*   Garam masala: ½ tsp
*   Kasoori Methi: 1 Tbsp

*   Malai: 2 Tbsp
*   Salt: to taste
*   Chopped Coriander: 1 Tbsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  Peel the lauki, cut into ¼" thick rounds, and shallow fry in a pan with 2-3 tsp oil until golden on both sides. Take out and keep in a plate.
2.  In the same pan, add 1 Tbsp oil. Once hot, add cumin, hing, and ginger chili paste along with all the whole spices.
3.  Once cumin starts to splutter, switch the flame off and quickly add all ground spices and mix well.
4.  Now add the beaten curd, stirring continuously.
5.  Put the flame on again, add 1/2 cup of water, malai, and kasoori methi. Mix well.
6.  Once the mixture comes to a boil, add the lauki, salt to taste, and half the coriander.
7.  Turn the flame to low, put the lid on, and let it simmer for 8 to 10 minutes (till the lauki is tender). Adjust the consistency as required.
8.  Serve hot garnished with coriander.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you finish the walls, you can give three walls of tiles of one kind, but the fourth wall, either in pattern or color, should be starkly different. That becomes the kind of highlight wall, and that wall should ideally be the one that you face when you enter the toilet. That creates a very, very interesting effect in the toilet, and it makes it lively and very pleasant.</p>
