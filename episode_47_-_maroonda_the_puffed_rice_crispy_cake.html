                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>In wet areas of the house, such as terraces or balconies, the flooring should have a slope. There should be a jaali on one corner, towards which the floor slopes. The jaali should be inside a khurra. A khurra is a square, depressed part of the floor. This will restrict any backflow of water to the terrace or balcony.</p>
