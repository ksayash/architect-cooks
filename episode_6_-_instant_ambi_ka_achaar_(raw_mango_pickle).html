                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This is a quick and easy instant pickle recipe that is perfect for the summer months when raw mangoes are in season. This recipe is a personal favorite and is made every year when the first raw mangoes appear in the market. The pickle is a combination of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors that are sure to tantalize your taste buds. The use of mustard oil gives the pickle a unique flavor that is both pungent and savory. This pickle is best enjoyed with rice, roti, or paratha.</p>
