                    <p>One major mistake which many of our clients have done before they've come to us is that the lights and fans positioning, they don't pay attention that when the fan is running, the light rays should not cut from it. That is a very major mistake that can happen. So when you're placing the lights and fans in the room, do take care that the light rays do not cut, get cut by the blades of the fan.</p>
