                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Doors have hinges to support the door from one side. If your door is taller or heavier, the normal three hinges may not be enough to take the load. In that case, you have to increase the number of hinges so that the door doesn't become lopsided because of the weight. The top of the door should have hinges that are closer together.</p>
