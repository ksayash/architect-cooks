                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   2-3 soft bananas (pureed) about ¾ cup
*   1 heaped cup Singhada or Kuttu flour
*   1 tsp Baking powder
*   1 tsp Baking soda
*   A pinch of Salt
*   ¾ cup Sugar
*   ¼ cup Refined oil
*   ½ cup Milk
*   1 tsp Cinnamon powder
*   ½ cup Chopped Walnuts</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a big mixing bowl, put pureed bananas, sugar, oil, milk, and cinnamon powder. Mix everything well.</li>
<li>Gradually fold the flour mix into the wet batter. Gently fold.</li>
<li>Butter/oil the baking dish and line with parchment paper. Pour the batter into it, tap it twice, and garnish with chopped walnuts.</li>
<li>Bake it for 45 to 55 mins in a pre-heated oven at 180 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Once done, put the baking dish on a wire rack. Once cool, demould it, slice it, and enjoy this delicious cake.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong>
*   At around 30 minutes, cover the cake with foil to prevent the top from burning.
*   Do not demould the cake while it is still hot, as it will crumble. Wait 15-20 minutes for the steam to escape and the cake to set.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When constructing your house, if the next property is very close, you want a visual barrier. Instead of a wall or concrete, plant bamboo trees along the boundary. By the time construction is complete, the bamboo will have grown tall and dense, forming a natural and visually pleasing green barrier.</p>
