                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Matar Paneer Bhurji is a traditional Indian dish that's simple to make but tastes great. This recipe uses crumbled paneer, which is Indian cheese, and peas. The paneer used in this recipe is a byproduct of making ghee, but store-bought paneer works just as well. This recipe is a zero-waste dish, as all the byproducts of making ghee can be used in other dishes. The dish is cooked with simple spices like turmeric, coriander, and Kashmiri red chili powder. Milk is added to give it a creamy texture. This dish is perfect for a quick and easy meal. It can be served with roti or paratha, or even used as a filling for toast or sandwiches.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When constructing a new house, it's important to use high-quality, smooth planks for shuttering during the casting of roofs and columns. This ensures a straight and even surface, which not only improves the finish of the house but also reduces the amount of plaster needed later on. A straight surface will consume less plaster than a crooked surface. This small detail can make a big difference in the overall quality and cost-effectiveness of the construction.</p>
