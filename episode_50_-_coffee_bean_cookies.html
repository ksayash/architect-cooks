                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>During the construction of any house, a common problem is seepage in external walls or on the toilet walls. Of course, we have to be very careful with the type of pipes we use, and they shouldn't burst, so the quality should be good. But one more thing that you can do is that when external walls of the house or toilet walls, or wherever wet areas are, when you do brickwork, in the brickwork's mortar, you should mix in some waterproofing compound. If you do that, it will solve the water seepage problem.</p>
