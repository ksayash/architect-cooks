                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>The tip is about the disposal of kitchen waste. The kitchen waste that is green, like peels of vegetables or egg shells, should not be put in the normal waste. If you live in a house with a front or back yard, dig a 2 ft x 2 ft x 2 ft hole in the soil and put your kitchen waste in that. Also add leaves, twigs, or grass that is cut in the garden. Within 2-3 months, you will have a great fertilizer to put in the plants.</p>
