                    <p>Normally, water tanks in homes are placed on the top floor. In the plain areas of India, where the sun is very strong, water heats up quickly in the summer. Paint your water tank in a reflective white or use a surface that reflects heat instead of absorbing it. This will reduce the intensity of the heat to some extent.</p>
