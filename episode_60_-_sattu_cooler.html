                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This Sattu Cooler is a traditional recipe from Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh. It is a salty and tangy drink that is perfect for hot summer days. It is said that drinking this every day will protect you from heat stroke. Sattu is made from roasted black gram, which is rich in protein, fiber, and minerals. This drink is so nutritious that it can even be used as a breakfast substitute. The chopped onions add a surprising crunch to the cooler, but can be omitted if you don't like them.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>The tip of the day is related to the location of the various workspaces in the kitchen. There are three major places of work: the gas stove, the sink, and the refrigerator. The positioning of these three should be carefully considered. The distance between any two of these should not be less than four feet and should not be greater than nine feet. This distance increases the efficiency in the kitchen by a great deal.</p>
