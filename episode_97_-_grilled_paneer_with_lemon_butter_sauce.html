*   ½ cup cauliflower (cut into florets)
*   ½ cup mushrooms (cut into halves)
*   2 tsp oil
*   2 tsp butter

*   1 tsp minced garlic
*   1 Tbsp finely chopped onion
*   1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
*   ½ cup milk
*   2-3 Tbsp fresh cream
*   ½ tsp pepper powder
*   1 tsp finely chopped coriander/parsley
*   Salt to taste</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Steam or microwave all the vegetables (other than potatoes) so that they are slightly tender.</li>
<li>In a pan, add 1 Tbsp butter and oil. Add the garlic. Saute for half a minute. Add the onion, saute till translucent. Add the flour and roast well. Add the milk while stirring continuously. Add cream and mix well. Add salt and pepper. Add the rest of the butter. Take off the flame and add the lemon juice and coriander. Mix well and keep aside. The sauce is ready.</li>
<li>In a grill pan, add 1 tsp of oil and butter. Add the chili flakes and herbs. Grill the paneer pieces on both sides. Keep aside. In the same pan, grill the potatoes too.</li>
<li>In another pan, add the remaining butter and oil. Add all the other vegetables. Saute with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Plate the paneer and vegetables. Pour the sauce and serve hot.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   When steaming or microwaving the vegetables, be careful not to overcook them. You want them to be slightly tender, but still have a bit of a crunch.
*   When making the sauce, be sure to stir constantly to prevent lumps from forming.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When your house is being built, plant trees or plants along the boundary or open areas that are certain to be green areas later on. That way, by the time you move into the house, it is already beautifully landscaped. This is important because it integrates the landscaping into the architecture of the house.</p>
