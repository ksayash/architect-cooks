                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These coconut cookies are a delicious treat that is made with whole wheat flour, making them a healthier option than traditional cookies. The use of ghee adds a rich flavor, while the dry-roasted coconut provides a delightful aroma. These cookies are not overly sweet, allowing the natural flavors of the coconut and wheat to shine through. They are incredibly simple to make, requiring just a few basic ingredients and minimal effort. The cookies have a slightly crumbly texture, which adds to their charm. They are perfect for enjoying with a cup of tea or coffee, or as a light snack any time of day.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   Whole wheat flour: ½ cup
*   Ghee: 2 Tbsp (semi-solid)
*   Desiccated coconut: 1 Tbsp heaped (dry roasted)
*   Caster sugar: 2½ Tbsp
*   Milk: 3 Tbsp
*   Salt: a pinch
*   Baking powder: ½ tsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Whisk together the ghee and sugar for about a minute, until the ghee changes color and becomes a little fluffy.</li>
<li>Mix all the other ingredients, except milk, together and add to the ghee and sugar mixture. Bring together with a fork.</li>
<li>Add 2 Tbsp of the milk. Bind to form a dough. Add a little more milk if required.</li>
<li>Shape into a block, wrap in a piece of butter paper, and chill in the fridge for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Take out the block, cut into desired thickness, and bake for about 15 to 18 minutes until done. It is better to line the baking dish with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from burning at the base.</li>
<li>Once cool, store in an airtight bottle.</li>
</ol>

                    <p>A very overlooked feature that many of us at times forget to provide in the house is the lightning conductor. It's a very simple thing that we can give for protection against lightning. If you are building a new house, then essentially give it. If your existing house also, then without any demolition, very easily lightning conductor can be installed.</p>
