                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Makhana, also known as fox nuts, are a healthy and delicious snack option for those looking to control their calorie intake. This recipe offers a simple and effective way to roast makhana in the oven, ensuring an even and consistent result. Roasting makhana in the oven is a convenient alternative to the traditional method of roasting them in a pan on the gas stove. This method eliminates the need for constant stirring and reduces the risk of burning. The use of ghee adds a rich flavor to the makhana, while the salt enhances its natural taste. This recipe is perfect for those seeking a quick, easy, and nutritious snack that can be stored for several days.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups raw makhana (approx. 40 grams)</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon desi ghee (clarified butter)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 150 degrees Celsius (300 degrees Fahrenheit) on bake mode (bottom heating element only).</li>
<li>In a bowl, combine the raw makhana, salt, and desi ghee.</li>
<li>Mix well to ensure the makhana is evenly coated with ghee and salt.</li>
<li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (optional, but recommended for non-stick baking sheets).</li>
<li>Spread the makhana in a single layer on the baking sheet, avoiding overcrowding.</li>
<li>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven.</li>
<li>After 10 minutes, lightly toss the makhana with a spatula to ensure even roasting.</li>
<li>Check the makhana after 15 minutes. They should be easily crumbled when pressed. If not, continue roasting for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
<li>Once the makhana is roasted to a crisp, crumbly texture, switch off the oven and remove the baking sheet.</li>
<li>Allow the makhana to cool completely on the baking sheet.</li>
<li>Store the cooled makhana in an airtight container. They will stay fresh for up to 15-20 days.</li>
</ol>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"Wooden shelves come in about maybe two to three inches in width and one foot to two feet to even three feet in length and very nicely finished natural wood shelves. These can be hung on the wall in the drawing room, or behind the bed, or in the dining area. You just screw them to the wall. As it is, in itself also they look very pretty when screwed to the wall and on top you have ample space to display your small little memorabilia or artifacts that you've collected from various places that you've visited." This is important because it provides a way to display artifacts in smaller homes.</p>
