The dish is garnished with green coriander and a few drops of fresh cream. The recipe is made in two steps. The first step is to cook the tomato and onion gravy. The second step is to blend the gravy and add the paneer.</p>

                    <p>Windows are an essential part of any building, whether it is a house or an office. To ensure a smooth and even surface around the window opening, use a stone such as granite. This will give you a straight surface and the measurement to make the windows becomes very easy. The finishing is easy and leakage is reduced.</p>
