                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>The architectural tip is related to rain water. The rain water that falls on the terraces and then we rain water pipes through its discharge. One way is that we take it to the rain water harvesting pit. If there is a pipe that is not going into the harvesting pit, then my suggestion is that the house's manhole or the main discharge pipe, you should connect it with that. This is to avoid spillage of water on the ground.</p>
