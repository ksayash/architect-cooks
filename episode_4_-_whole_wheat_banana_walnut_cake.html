                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When doing tile work, it is important to leave space in between the tiles and use epoxy grout. In India, many people still install tiles edge-to-edge and fill the gaps with white cement. However, this is not the correct way to install tiles. Over time, the joints will get dirty and may even crack. By using epoxy grout, you can ensure that your tile work looks neat and lasts for many years.</p>
