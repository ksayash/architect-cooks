                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   1½ cup poha/chooda (washed a couple of times and sprinkled with a Tbsp of water at least a couple of hours before cooking)
*   2 cups cabbage (chopped)
*   1 cup carrot (grated)
*   1 small onion (chopped)
*   1 small potato (cut into small cubes)
*   1 small capsicum (chopped finely)
*   ½ cup green peas (parboiled)
*   2 Tbsp peanuts
*   1 tsp split urad
*   ½ tsp channa daal
*   1 tsp black mustard seeds
*   ¼ tsp ginger (grated)
*   7-8 curry leaves (cut coarsely)
*   2 whole dry red chilies
*   2-3 green chilies (chopped)
*   1 Tbsp lemon juice
*   Coriander for garnishing (chopped)
*   Salt to taste
*   Red chili powder to taste
*   2-3 Tbsp oil</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  In a pan/kadai, add the oil. Add the peanuts. Cook until they start to crackle.
2.  Add the daals, mustard seeds, red chilies, green chilies, ginger, and curry leaves. Saute for about a minute.
3.  Add the onion and potatoes. Cook for a couple of minutes, until the potato is done.
4.  Add all the vegetables, except the capsicum. Stir on high flame for a minute. Add the salt and red chili powder.
5.  Now add the soaked poha and toss well. Sprinkle about 2 to 3 Tbsp of water while gently fluffing up the poha.
6.  Add the lemon juice and capsicum and mix well.
7.  Cover with a lid and switch the flame off. Rest for 5-10 minutes.
8.  Serve hot, garnished with green coriander.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking tip:</strong> Soaking the poha a couple of hours before cooking helps it to become soft and fluffy.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When designing interiors, it's important to consider the use of curtains versus Roman blinds. Curtains are best suited for walls with many windows, providing a full wall length and floor-to-ceiling coverage. For smaller windows, Roman blinds can be a better choice, especially when paired with curtains on larger windows in the same room. This mix-and-match approach can create a cohesive and stylish look, while also providing the right amount of light control and privacy.</p>
