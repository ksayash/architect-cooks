                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you build a new house or take an apartment, do ensure, especially in a place like India where we have mosquitoes and insects, that all the windows or external opening doors have a provision in the frame for the mesh door or the mesh window frame. Even if you don't put that initially, but at any later stage if you want to put it, that provision is already there. If you don't give that, then it becomes a problem.</p>
