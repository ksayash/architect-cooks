                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Gun powder, also known as podi powder, is a spicy condiment that is normally served with South Indian food. It is a spicy accessory to food that can be used in many different ways. You can sprinkle it dry on top of idli or dosa. You can also coat idlis in the powder and saute them in oil or ghee. Another way to use it is to put a spoonful of the powder in your plate and add a spoonful of hot ghee. Mix it up and have it with idli, dosa, curd rice, or steamed rice. It can even be eaten with plain parathe.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Sesame seeds: ¼ cup
* Urad daal: ½ cup
* Chana daal: ¼ cup
* Whole red chillies: 12-15
* Curry leaves: ½ cup
* Oil: 3 tsp
* Salt: to taste
* Turmeric: ½ tsp
* Hing: ½ tsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. In a pan, dry roast the sesame seeds until golden. Remove to a plate.
2. In the same pan, add 2 tsp oil. Add the red chillies. Sauté until they puff up and then add the curry leaves. Sauté until crisp. Remove to a plate.
3. Now add a tsp of oil to the pan. Roast the daals until golden.
4. Allow everything to cool down. Then transfer to a blender, add salt, haldi, and hing. Blend to a coarse powder.
5. Store in a clean bottle in the fridge. It should last for two to three months.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking tips:</strong>
* It is very important that the ingredients are completely cool before blending. If they are warm, the sesame seeds and daal may release their oil and create a sticky paste.
* When blending, pulse the ingredients for 5 seconds at a time. This will prevent the jar from heating up and releasing the oil from the sesame seeds and daal.
* The amount of red chillies can be adjusted to your spice level.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When constructing a house, flat, or bungalow, it is important to consider the waterproofing of the toilets. This is especially important on upper floors. The part of the floor that is sunk to allow for the fixtures' traps and pipes should have top-quality waterproofing. If there is a leak after the toilet is finished, it can be a big problem and a big headache.</p>
