                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Shepherd's pie is a classic dish that originated in Britain. It's a wholesome meal in itself, normally made with meat, but this recipe is a vegetarian version. It's an assortment of vegetables cooked together with tomato sauce and then topped with a layer of mashed potatoes. The flavors of the garlic and sauteed onion give it all the flavor. It is a full meal in itself, with carrots rich in vitamins and minerals, mushrooms with other minerals and protein, green peas full of proteins, and potatoes full of carbs. Mushrooms also have a lot of fiber.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When constructing a house, a common mistake is forgetting to give a level difference to the wet areas of the house, such as the kitchen, toilets, and balconies. Even if your balcony has a slope towards the drain pipe, your toilet has a slope toward the trap, and your kitchen has a slope toward the sink, if there is no level difference from the main house, there is a great chance that the water will seep into your main house. The flooring should be half an inch lower than the rest of the house's flooring. This ensures that the water does not go inside the house and makes life much simpler.</p>
