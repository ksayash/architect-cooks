                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Khatai is a delicious Indian cookie that is often made with maida (all-purpose flour). This recipe uses whole wheat flour instead, making it a healthier option. The addition of pistachios gives it a unique flavor and texture. These cookies are soft to bite and melt in your mouth. They are perfect with a hot cup of tea or coffee. The recipe is quick and easy to make, and the cookies can be stored in an airtight container for later. The cookies are baked in an OTG oven, which is a type of oven that is commonly used in India. The cookies are baked until they are light pink at the base, which is a sign that they are cooked through.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ghee: ¼ cup (semi-solid) 55g</li>
<li>Caster Sugar: ¼ cup</li>
<li>Whole wheat flour: ½ cup + 1 Tbsp</li>
<li>Besan: 1 tsp</li>
<li>Pista: 1 Tbsp (chopped)</li>
<li>Milk: As and if required</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the OTG to 160 degrees Celsius bake mode only.</li>
<li>Whisk the sugar and ghee together for about 45 seconds, till creamy.</li>
<li>Add the whole wheat flour, besan and chopped pista (leaving a little for garnish).</li>
<li>Mix well and bring the dough together. Do not knead.</li>
<li>Add a little milk if required to bind the dough.</li>
<li>Make small balls, flatten a little and put on the baking dish.</li>
<li>Make a shallow cross on the top with a butter knife.</li>
<li>Garnish with some chopped Pista.</li>
<li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, till light pink at the base.</li>
<li>Take out. Cool and then store in an air tight container.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cooking tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ghee should be semi-solid, not fully melted. If it is fully melted, put it in the fridge for 10 minutes to solidify it slightly.</li>
<li>Do not overbake the cookies, as they will become hard.</li>
<li>Let the cookies cool completely before storing them, as they will be very crumbly when they are warm.</li>
</ul>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When renovating your home, if you are changing the flooring and the existing flooring is any type of tile, do not remove the existing base. You get a very flat, straight base to work with. With the help of fixing adhesives, you can lay the new tile on top of the old one. The room height will only be reduced by the thickness of the new tile.</p>
