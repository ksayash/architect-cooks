                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This dish is a universally loved recipe that is made with potatoes and cheese. It can be used as an evening appetizer or as a side dish for the main course. The potatoes are par-boiled and then peeled before being cut into halves. The dish is cooked in a pan with butter, oil, garlic, and various spices. The cheese is sprinkled on top and then covered with a lid to let it melt. The dish is served hot and is sure to be a hit with kids and adults alike. The chopped coriander adds a fresh flavor to the dish, and the combination of spices gives it a unique taste.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you are building a house, if you have a basement, attic, or upper floor that you don't want to use right now, make sure to take care of the basic services like plumbing and electrical in the first phase itself. This is called future-proofing the house so that when you need to use that space, it's a minor work to finish it. If you don't do this, it's a whole different game plan.</p>
