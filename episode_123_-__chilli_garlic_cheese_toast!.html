                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"How do you make a house look bigger than it actually is? Is by making the outdoor space an integral part of the indoor. So if your ground floor flat is or if your any flat where you have a open terrace open out so be very careful to give huge patio doors there double doors glazed doors which when you open kind of make the outdoor and indoor as a one space." This is important because it can make a small space feel larger and more open.</p>
