                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Potatoes: 4 medium (boiled, peeled, and cut into one-inch cubes)
* Cumin seeds: 1 tsp
* Roasted cumin powder: 1 tsp
* Coriander powder: 2 tsp
* Salt: to taste
* Red chili powder: 1 tsp
* Dry mango powder (amchoor): 1 tsp
* Green chilies: 2 to 3 (slit)
* Garlic: 1 tsp (chopped)
* Coriander: 1/2 cup (chopped)
* Oil: 2 Tbsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. In a pan, take oil and heat.
2. Once the oil is hot, add the whole cumin seeds. As soon as it splutters, add the potatoes.
3. Sauté for about a couple of minutes.
4. Once the aloo changes color, add all the spices, the garlic, and the green chilies.
5. Sauté for 4 to 5 minutes, and then add the coriander, leaving a little for garnishing.
6. Serve the hot chatpate jeera aloo garnished with coriander as a meal with parathas/roti or as an evening snack.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking tips:</strong>
* When boiling the potatoes, drain them immediately after the steam is over. If you leave them in the water for too long, they will become soggy.
* Make sure the oil is hot before adding the cumin seeds. This will help the cumin seeds to splutter and release their flavor.
* Do not let the cumin seeds brown. Just let them change color.
* The size of the potatoes is up to you. You can keep them a little bigger if you want.</p>

                    <p>When we do tile work in the toilets, there's usually a slope in the floor where the drain is. A very common mistake in tile work is that people start tiling from the floor and go up. You should first decide what height you want the tiling to be, mark the top line, and start tiling from there. That way, the slope will be in the last tile near the floor, and you'll have a regular level above.</p>
