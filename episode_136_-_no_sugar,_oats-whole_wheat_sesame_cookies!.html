                    <p>Where you get a chance, you can put a loft for a slab. Whether it is between two doors, there is some space you are getting, or whether it is above the kitchen slab. Where you get it, that kind of loft is very useful. Some kind of dead storage which you do not want to access every day, but still, there are things you want to keep around. So these lofts are very useful.</p>
