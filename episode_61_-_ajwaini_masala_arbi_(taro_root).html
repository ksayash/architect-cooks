<ol>
<li>Add a little salt, red chili powder, and half the ajwain to the besan and mix well.</li>

<li>Take two pans and put on gas simultaneously. Add 2 Tbsp of oil in each.</li>
<li>In one pan, add the coated arbi one by one and let it brown evenly on medium flame. Once done on one side, flip the pieces so that the other side can be browned too.</li>
<li>In the meantime, in the other pan, add ajwain, garlic, jeera, and hing. Saute well. Add the onions. Cook till they start to change color. Now add the green chillies and all the dry spices, except garam masala and amchoor.</li>
<li>Once done, add the shallow-fried arbi to this masala. Stir well to coat the arbi with the masala. Put flame to minimum and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the amchoor, garam masala, and half the coriander. Mix well.</li>
<li>Switch off the flame and serve hot, garnished with the rest of the chopped coriander.</li>
</ol>

                    <p>Rainwater harvesting is a great way to contribute to Mother Earth. A rainwater pit can be easily added to an existing house. Simply dig a pit near the pipe where rainwater flows from the terrace. The water is filtered in layers and percolated back into the ground, increasing the ground water level.</p>
