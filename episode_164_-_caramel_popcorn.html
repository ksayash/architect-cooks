                    <p>One of the very popular finishes is the exposed brick finish, where you use machine-cut quality bricks to build your entire house. But the challenge that comes with it is that when it rains or water falls on it, moss grows on it. That's not a very pleasant sight to look at. For that, a very easy solution is that whenever you give this kind of exposed brick finish, put a clear coat of silicone paint on it. As a result, not only is the penetration power of the brick stopped, but there is a transparent shield that doesn't let the water stop. If you put that on and keep repainting it maybe once even every five years, it works beautifully, and the surface looks as good as new.</p>
