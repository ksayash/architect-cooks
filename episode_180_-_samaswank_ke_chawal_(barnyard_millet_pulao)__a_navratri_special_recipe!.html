                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>Many balconies have a facing or orientation that makes them unusable during certain times of the year. To make a balcony more usable, add an awning to the outside of the roof. Awnings are made of fabric and attached to a steel structure. They extend the roof of the balcony and come in curved or slanted shapes.</p>
