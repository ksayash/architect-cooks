                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Jhalmuri is a popular Indian street food snack that is loved by both kids and adults. It is a light and healthy snack that is perfect for any time of day. This recipe is a simple version of Jhalmuri that is easy to make at home. It is a great way to use up leftover boiled potatoes and onions. The addition of mustard oil adds a unique twist to the flavor of the Jhalmuri. This recipe is also very versatile, and you can add other ingredients to it, such as sev, aloo bhujia, chana, or dry coconut. The Jhalmuri is traditionally served in paper cones, which makes it a fun and festive snack.</p>

                    <p>For those who want greenery in their homes, but have small balconies, the idea of hanging pots is a great solution. You can install hooks on the ceiling of your balcony and hang pots from them. Ideally, you should install the hooks during construction. If you don't end up using them, they won't interfere with you. But if you ever want to hang pots, it becomes very simple. This saves balcony space and still allows you to enjoy greenery.</p>
