                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a simple way to make cream cheese at home. It uses full-cream milk, cream, lemon juice, and salt. The cream is added to give the cream cheese a creamy texture. The lemon juice is used to separate the whey from the cottage cheese. The salt is added to enhance the flavor and texture of the cream cheese. The whey is saved to be used later. The cream cheese can be used in a variety of dishes, such as cheesecake, cake frosting, and salad dressing. It can also be used as a dip with herbs and sea salt.</p>

                    <p>Anti-termite treatment is a common thing, but we have seen that until your house or your house's part is termite infested, you don't realize that you have to get it done. If you are building a new house, right at the foundation stage, when your foundation digs, at that stage, if you do the first round of anti-termite treatment, and then once it comes to the tie beam level, if you are constructing a house, you would know that term, so the second treatment of the round there, then your house termite infestation is very less.</p>
