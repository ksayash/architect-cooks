                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is for a peanut jaggery cake, also known as peanut chikki. It is a snack, dessert, or bite-sized treat that is healthy and tasty. The cake is made with minimal ingredients, including roasted peanuts, jaggery, and fennel seeds. The peanuts are roasted and the skin is removed. The jaggery is cut into small pieces. The fennel seeds can be raw or roasted, but can be avoided if you don't like the flavor. The jaggery is cooked until it melts and then the peanuts and fennel seeds are added. The mixture is poured onto a flat surface and shaped into a thin cake with a rolling pin. The cake is stored in an airtight container once cool.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When building a house or building, and you plan to make two or three floors, but only build two floors, the columns or pillars that you give, the iron that comes out, you leave it out because you know that sooner or later you're going to construct more, so it's easier if the iron is out, the upper floor is easier to make. Do consult your local architect or structural engineer and they will tell you about some good waterproofing compounds, with which you can paint it and then tie it up with something, so that the iron is as good as new, it does not lose its strength.</p>
