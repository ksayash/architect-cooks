                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a quick and easy appetizer or side dish that can be made in under 30 minutes. The mushrooms are roasted with garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper until they are tender and caramelized. The balsamic vinegar adds a touch of sweetness and acidity that balances out the richness of the mushrooms. The chopped coriander adds a fresh, herbaceous note. This dish is perfect for a weeknight meal or a party. It can be served as an appetizer with garlic toast or as a side dish with soup.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Mushrooms (250g)
* Garlic (7-8 cloves)
* Olive Oil (2 Tbsp)
* Salt (to taste)
* Black pepper (½ tsp)
* Balsamic Vinegar (1 tsp)
* Coriander (chopped, for garnishing)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 230 degrees Celsius.
2. Trim and half /quarter mushrooms and place on a rimmed baking dish. Smash the garlic cloves and add them to the baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Toss to coat and spread out in a single layer.
3. Roast, tossing halfway through, until the mushrooms are tender and caramelized, 18 to 20 minutes total. 
4. Remove from the oven, drizzle with balsamic vinegar, and toss to coat. 
5. Garnish with chopped coriander and serve hot.</p>
<p><em>Tip: When arranging the mushrooms on the baking sheet, make sure that each mushroom touches the base so that it roasts properly. If the mushrooms are overlapping, they will not roast evenly.</em></p>

                    <p>When you are doing paint work, before you give the final coat, wait. After you've completed all that, then give the final coat of the paint so that when you shift into a new house or when you have a newly painted house, there are no stains. This is important because even if you are careful, some paint will get on the walls.</p>
