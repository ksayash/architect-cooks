                <p>This instant ginger and green chilli pickle is a must-have in every Indian kitchen. It is a quick and easy way to add a burst of flavor to any meal. This pickle is made without cooking, so it's ready to eat as soon as it's made. It's a great digestive aid and adds a lot to the taste of food. The pickle is made with fresh ginger, green chilies, lemon juice, and salt. The lemon juice and salt act as preservatives, so the pickle can be stored in the fridge for up to a month. The ginger turns a nice pink color due to the lemon juice. This pickle is a great way to add a little spice to your life.</p>

                    <p>When deciding on window coverings, Roman blinds or curtains are best for bedrooms. For formal areas of the house, you can comfortably give roller blinds. The transparency or translucency can be decided based on how much light you want.</p>
