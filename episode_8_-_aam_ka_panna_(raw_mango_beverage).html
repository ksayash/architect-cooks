                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Aam Panna is a refreshing summer cooler that is sweet, sour, and tangy. This recipe is for a concentrate that can be stored in the fridge for up to two months. The concentrate is made with raw mangoes, water, sugar, cumin powder, and black salt. The raw mangoes should be tart and not fibrous. The cumin powder should be roasted. The concentrate can be mixed with cold water, ice cubes, and mint leaves to make a refreshing Aam Panna drink. This recipe is an instant version of the traditional Aam Panna recipe, which is more complicated and time-consuming.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Raw mango: 1 cup (peeled and cut into cubes)
* Water: 3/4th cup
* Sugar: 3/4th cup (equal to the strained pulp of mango}
* Cumin powder: 1 tsp (roasted)
* Black salt: 1.5 tsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. In a pressure cooker, add the mango and water. Cook for 1 whistle on high followed by 5 to 6 minutes on low flame.
2. Once cool, grind in a blender and strain the pulp to remove any strands.
3. Mix the sugar, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well to dissolve the sugar, or leave for 10-15 minutes.
4. Store in a clean, airtight glass bottle in the fridge. Lasts easily for a month.
5. To make the panna drink, add 2 to 3 tbsp of the concentrate in a glass, top with cold water/ice cubes. Garnish with chopped mint leaves and enjoy this mango summer cooler.</p>
