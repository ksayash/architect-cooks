                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This is a delicious and simple potato and tomato curry that is perfect for any occasion. It is a no-onion, no-garlic recipe, making it ideal for fasting days. This dish is very versatile and can be eaten with poori, rice, or roti. The key to making this dish special is to crumble the potatoes by hand, leaving uneven edges and some mashed pieces. This helps to thicken the curry and adds to the flavor. The dish is also made with a variety of spices, including black mustard seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida, turmeric powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, amchur powder, and coriander powder. These spices give the dish a complex and flavorful taste.</p>

                    <p>If you want a lotus pond in the house, don't have to wait anymore. You can use large concrete containers, known as "naad," which are often used to feed cattle. These containers work very well in houses and can be used to create a miniature lotus pond. You can have your water lilies, your lotuses, your water hyacinth, and what not.</p>
