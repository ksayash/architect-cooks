                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Paneer Methi Malai is a popular Indian dish that combines the richness of paneer (Indian cheese) with the earthy flavor of fresh methi (fenugreek leaves) and the creaminess of malai (cream). This dish is especially delightful during the fresh methi season, offering a healthy and flavorful option that can be prepared quickly. The methi leaves are finely chopped and sautéed to reduce their bitterness, while the paneer adds a soft, milky texture. The creamy sauce, enriched with a blend of spices, creates a harmonious balance of flavors that is both comforting and appetizing. This recipe is perfect for those seeking a nutritious and delicious vegetarian meal that is easy to prepare.</p>

                    <p>"Even if you have an independent bungalow which is a G+2 or a G+3 or even a G+1 story high, during the time of planning, during the time of construction, do make a provision for a lift. You can provide a lift for whatever reason, then structurally it becomes very very simple." This allows for easier installation of a lift in the future, should the need arise.</p>
