                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a delicious and easy-to-make puri made with Singhade ka Atta (water chestnut flour). It's a great option for those observing fasts, as it's a vrat-friendly dish. The addition of mashed potatoes helps bind the dough, making it easier to roll out. The puris are deep-fried until golden brown and crispy, making them a satisfying and flavorful treat. You can use Kuttu ka Atta instead of Singhade ka Atta, if you prefer. The procedure remains the same. If you are making paratha, it will soak up more oil.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you are painting your house, use the best quality paint that is available in the market. Although it may seem a little expensive at the time, if you use a lower quality paint, you will have to repaint every two to three years. If you use a better quality paint, it will last for at least five to six years. The money is much better spent by investing in a better quality paint.</p>
