                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Dahi Bade is a popular Indian street food, but it is often deep-fried, making it less healthy. This recipe offers a guilt-free alternative that is quick and easy to make. Instead of frying, this recipe uses bread soaked in water and shaped into balls. The bread is then flavored with spices and herbs, giving it a similar taste to traditional Dahi Bade. The dish is topped with yogurt, tamarind chutney, and coriander, creating a delicious and refreshing snack or appetizer. This recipe is perfect for those who want to enjoy the flavors of Dahi Bade without the added calories and fat. It is also a great option for those who are short on time, as it can be made in just a few minutes.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When you make a house or a flat, and you give it doors, my suggestion to my clients is that for every door, you give it a lock. Every door has a separate key, but you make one set of master keys that you keep with you. That way, when you want to open any door in the house, you don't have to check the number and the door whether it goes. The master key operates all the doors. Life becomes much simpler like that.</p>
