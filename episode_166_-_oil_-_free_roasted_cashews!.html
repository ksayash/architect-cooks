                    <p>Wall art is a great way to brighten up a house or create a theme. However, wall art can often become crooked, with one side higher than the other. To prevent this, use double-sided tape on the back corners of the wall art to fix it to the wall. This will keep the wall art straight and prevent it from becoming crooked.</p>
