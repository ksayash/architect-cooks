                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These biscuits are a simple and healthy treat that can be made with ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen. They are made with whole wheat flour, which is a healthier alternative to white flour. The biscuits are also sweetened with brown sugar, which gives them a rich, molasses-like flavor. These biscuits are perfect for a quick snack or a light dessert. They can be enjoyed with a cup of coffee or tea, or they can be served with a scoop of ice cream. These biscuits are also a great way to use up leftover whole wheat flour. They are easy to make and can be customized to your liking. You can add different spices, nuts, or dried fruits to the dough to create your own unique flavor combinations.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   ½ cup whole wheat flour (63g)
*   2 Tbsp ghee (28g)
*   3 Tbsp caster sugar (33g)
*   ¼ tsp baking powder
*   A pinch of salt
*   1½ - 2 Tbsp milk</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius on bake mode.</li>
<li>In a bowl, whisk together the ghee and sugar for about a minute or two, until light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Add all the dry ingredients and mix well with a fork.</li>
<li>Add 1½ Tbsp of milk and mix well. Add up to ½ Tbsp more if needed.</li>
<li>Use your hands to gently knead the dough for about a minute.</li>
<li>Flatten the dough into a square on parchment paper.</li>
<li>Cut into rectangles, arrange on the baking dish, and make the pattern as shown.</li>
<li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden.</li>
<li>Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>
<li>Store in an airtight container once cool.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   If the biscuits are browning too quickly on the bottom, gently remove them from the baking dish and place them on a plate to cool.
*   If a biscuit breaks while you are transferring it to the baking sheet, simply press it back together. It will bake together in the oven.</p>
