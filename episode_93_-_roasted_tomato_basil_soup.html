                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This soup is a great appetizer before any meal, or a warming alternative to coffee or tea on a cold day. It's a quick and easy recipe that uses all-natural ingredients. The roasted tomatoes give the soup a rich, deep flavor, while the basil adds a touch of freshness. The garlic, cinnamon, cloves, and peppercorns add warmth and complexity. The soup is also very healthy, making it a great choice for a light meal or snack. It can be served with a garlic toast for a more substantial meal.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>At times what happens while you're constructing your house or building or whatever it may be, at that time you feel that this is all the construction that we'll need, we'll not need any more space. And even if the rules permit, you don't want to go any higher than what you've already done. And many times you don't even make provision for it in the structure. So this is a solution to that. You can make a pre-fabricated structure on the top-most floor.</p>
