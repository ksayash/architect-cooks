                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   Onion: 1 medium (cut into 8 quarters and leaves separated)
*   Potato: 1 medium (peeled and cut into half-inch cubes)
*   Peas: 1/4 cup
*   Carrot: 1 cup (cut into fingers)
*   Cauliflower: 1 cup (cut into flowerets)
*   Broccoli: 1/2 cup (cut into flowerets)
*   Beans: 1 cup (cut into 2" long pieces)
*   Garlic: 1 tsp (finely chopped - optional)
*   Bay leaves: 2
*   Cinnamon stick: 2 pieces, 1.5" long
*   Cloves: 4 to 5
*   Whole peppercorn: 6 to 8
*   Green cardamom: 2 to 3
*   Butter: 1 Tbsp
*   Oil: 1 Tbsp
*   Salt: to taste
*   Black pepper: to taste
*   All-purpose flour (maida): 2 Tbsp
*   Milk: 1/2 cup
*   Water: 2-3 cups</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Microwave (or steam) all vegetables, except onion, for 1.5 to 2 minutes.</li>
<li>In a pan, add butter and oil. Once hot, add the whole spices and garlic. Sauté for a minute and add the onion. After another minute, add all the vegetables. Sauté for a couple of minutes and add the all-purpose flour. Sauté until the flour turns light pink.</li>
<li>Now add 2 to 3 cups of water. Let it come to a boil. Once it boils for 2 to 3 minutes, add the salt, pepper, and milk.</li>
<li>As soon as it boils, adjust final consistency and serve hot with steamed rice or toast.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong>
*   Using butter and oil together when cooking is beneficial because if you use butter alone, it can burn.
*   When roasting the flour, be careful that it does not burn. It should change color, but not turn light pink.
*   The amount of water you add depends on the consistency you want.</p>

                    <p>"We have to dress up the stairwell. Many times, when the staircase goes up, the area underneath is very bland. That is an area where people don't know what to do with it. So, we have dressed it up with pebbles, white-colored pebbles. And on those pebbles, we have some vases and a standing lamp there. So, when you enter the house and when you first see this area, it is a beautiful area."</p>
