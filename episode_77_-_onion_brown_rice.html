                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   1 cup rice (washed well)
*   2 bay leaves
*   1 tsp cumin seeds
*   2 cinnamon sticks (1 inch each)
*   5-6 whole peppercorns
*   5-6 cloves
*   2 cups water
*   1 Tbsp oil
*   1 medium onion (finely chopped)
*   Salt to taste</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a kadai, take the oil. Once hot add all whole spices and saute until aromatic.</li>
<li>Add the onions. Cook on medium heat until the onions are evenly browned on all sides (dark brown, not black).</li>
<li>Add the water and salt. Put the lid on and turn the flame to high.</li>
<li>Once the water comes to a boil, add the washed rice. When water starts boiling again, turn the flame to low, mix well softly, and put the lid on.</li>
<li>Mix once after 5 to 6 minutes. Once the water is almost dry, switch off the flame and put the lid back on.</li>
<li>Let it rest for at least 15 to 20 minutes (preferably 30). Then turn it once slowly. The rice is now ready to serve.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cooking tip:</strong> If you are using new rice, reduce the amount of water to 1.5 or 1.75 cups to prevent the rice from becoming sticky.</p>
