                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Aloo Dum is a universally loved dish made with potatoes. It is a traditional Indian dish that is quick and easy to make. It can be eaten with steamed rice, paratha, poori, roti, or even bread. It is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed for any meal. The dish is made with baby potatoes, but normal-sized potatoes can be used if baby potatoes are not available. The potatoes are boiled and peeled, then marinated with turmeric, salt, and oil. The potatoes are then shallow fried until golden brown. The dish is finished with a tomato-based sauce and garnished with chopped coriander.</p>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>One very common question is whether to give the valance on top of the curtain or not. Valance is that extra smaller curtain which we give. If you have a normal rod in which you have your curtain, then I would recommend a valance because then that gives a very nice and neat finish at the top of the curtain.</p>
