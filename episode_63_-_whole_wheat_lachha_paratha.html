                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Lachhedar Paratha is a delicious and versatile Indian flatbread that can be enjoyed as a main dish or a side. This recipe uses whole wheat flour, making it a healthier option compared to traditional parathas made with refined flour. The addition of garlic paste, coriander, green chilies, ajwain, salt, and red chili powder creates a flavorful and aromatic experience. The unique folding technique ensures that the paratha has multiple layers, resulting in a flaky and crispy texture. It can be enjoyed on its own, or paired with a cup of tea or coffee.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>

<ol>

<li>Sprinkle garlic paste, coriander, green chilies, ajwain, salt, and red chili powder over the ghee-coated roti.</li>
<li>Fold the roti into a fan shape, pressing gently as you fold.</li>
<li>Roll the fan into a spiral and press down lightly.</li>
<li>Dust with whole wheat flour and roll into a paratha with light hands.</li>
<li>Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium heat.</li>
<li>Place the paratha on the tawa and cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute on each side.</li>
<li>Add 2 tsp of ghee to the tawa and cook the paratha, pressing gently, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
<li>Serve hot.</li>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"That natural stone is called Kota. As architects, we have realized that in recent years, because of so many artificial products coming in the market, somehow Kota has lost its value. But I personally feel that Kota stone is a beautiful material to be used in flooring. Especially your terraces, balconies, stores, where ever your rough and tough work has to be done, there you can just close your eyes and put Kota."</p>
