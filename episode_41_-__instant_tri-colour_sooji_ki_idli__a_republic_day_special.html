                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>These idlis are a quick and healthy breakfast option that doesn't require soaking any dal or rice overnight. They are made with semolina, which is also known as rava or sooji, making them a healthy and instant choice. This recipe adds a twist by creating tricolored idlis, perfect for serving during national festivals. The colors are achieved naturally using beetroot and spinach purees, making them visually appealing and nutritious. These idlis can be served with coconut chutney, sambar, or podi powder, offering a versatile and delicious breakfast or snack.</p>

<li>In a pan, heat oil. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and urad daal. Once they start to crackle, add curry leaves.</li>

<li>Divide the batter into three equal parts in separate bowls.</li>
<li>Add beetroot puree to one part and spinach puree to another. Leave the third part as is.</li>
<li>Add 1/3 tsp of baking soda or Eno to each part and mix well.</li>
<li>Oil the idli molds.</li>
<li>Quickly pour the batter into the molds.</li>
<li>Steam for 12 minutes.</li>
<li>Let the idlis sit in the steamer for 3-4 minutes after steaming.</li>

                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"It’s always preferable to give a chimney on top of your cooking hob or cooking stove. Because the chimney is a very concentrated way of easily taking all the fumes or the smoke." This prevents the smells from spreading throughout the house. Chimneys are also self-cleaning, with a small tray to collect the fat, making them easier to maintain than exhaust fans.</p>
