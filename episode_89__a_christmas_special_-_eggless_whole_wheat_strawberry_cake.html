                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When building a new house or apartment, it may seem lucrative to use single-phase wiring and a single-phase meter to save costs in the beginning. However, this is a mistake because as the years pass by, the number of electrical gadgets in the house will only increase. If you have to change the wiring and meter later, it becomes a major headache. Therefore, it is better to spend a little extra in the beginning and provide for three-phase wiring and a three-phase meter.</p>
