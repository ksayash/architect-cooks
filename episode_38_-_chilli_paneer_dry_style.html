                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Chili paneer is a Chinese dish that has been adapted by the Indian palate. It is a very loved and popular dish. It is a quick and easy dish to make, taking only 10 minutes including frying the paneer. It can be served as a starter, appetizer, or as a side dish with fried rice or hakka noodles. It is a dry style of chili paneer, so it is a thick mixture. The vegetables are crunchy, and the paneer is cooked.</p>

                    <p>One mistake that is often made while constructing a house is that the flooring is done before the door frames are installed. The door frame should always be embedded in the flooring. This is so that the joint between the door frame and the floor is sturdy and there is no gap in between.</p>
