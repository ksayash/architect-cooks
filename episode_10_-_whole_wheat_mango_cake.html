                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* 1/2 cup mango puree (from 1 large mango)
* 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* 1/2 cup milk (or as needed to adjust consistency)
* 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* Pinch of salt
* Oil for greasing the baking tin</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. Preheat the oven to 320°F (160°C). Grease a baking tin with oil.
2. In a glass bowl, mix together the sugar, oil, and mango puree.
3. In another bowl, mix together the whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Fold everything together. If the batter is too thick, add milk to adjust the consistency.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared baking tin and pat a couple of times to even it out. Top with the chopped walnuts.
6. Bake in the center of the oven for 25 to 35 minutes. Check after 25 minutes to see if it is done. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.
7. Once done, take the cake out and place it on a wire rack to cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before cutting.
8. Enjoy the delicious, moist mango cake with tea or coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> It is important to grease the baking tin well and preheat the oven to ensure that the cake bakes evenly and comes out easily.</p>
