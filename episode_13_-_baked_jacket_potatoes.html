                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Baked jacket potatoes are a simple dish that can be made quickly and easily. The potatoes are first parboiled, then scooped out and filled with a mixture of cream, curd, lemon juice, spices, and cheese. The potatoes are then baked until the cheese is melted and golden brown. This dish is perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal or a fancy appetizer. It's a great way to use up leftover potatoes, and it's sure to please even the pickiest eaters. The combination of creamy potatoes, tangy lemon juice, and savory spices is simply irresistible.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
* Potatoes: 2 big (parboiled)
* Fresh cream: 2 Tbsp
* Curd: 2 Tbsp
* Lemon juice: 1 Tbsp
* Green chillies: 2-3 (chopped finely)
* Green coriander: 1 Tbsp (chopped finely)
* Salt: to taste
* Black pepper powder: 1/2 tsp
* Processed cheese: 4 Tbsp (grated)
* Oil: for brushing
* Italian seasoning (or any herbs): 1 tsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1. Preheat the oven at bake mode to 200 degrees Celsius.
2. Cut the potatoes longitudinally, with skin (jacket) on. Scoop from inside, leaving about half cm along the edges.
3. Brush oil on all sides of the scooped potatoes. Sprinkle some salt, pepper and herbs on the top and put in the oven to bake for about 5 to 7 minutes.
4. In the meantime, take the potato pulp in a mixing bowl. Mash well. Add the cream, curd, lemon juice, salt, pepper, green chilies, coriander and half the grated cheese. Mix well.
5. Take out the potato shells and refill them with the prepared mixture. Top with remaining grated cheese and bake again for about 20 minutes or till the cheese melts and turns a golden brown.
6. Serve hot.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking tip:</strong>
* If the potatoes are not mashing well, you can use a grater to grate them.
* The amount of cream, curd, and lemon juice can be varied depending on the size of the potatoes.
* Spices can be varied to taste.</p>

                    <p>Do use toughened glass instead of normal glass. Initial cost is a little bit more, but it is much simpler in the long run. Road facing windows can shatter if a pebble or ball hits them. For security purposes, use toughened glass in your windows.</p>
