                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular appetizer dish that is quick to make and tastes delicious. This recipe is a restaurant-style dish that can be made at home without a tandoor. The key to this dish is the marinade, which is made with thick curd, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, Kashmiri red chili powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala, chaat masala, salt, roasted kasoori methi, roasted gram flour, lemon juice, and oil. The paneer, onion, tomato, and capsicum are marinated in this mixture for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. The dish is then roasted on a pan until it is cooked through and slightly charred.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   Paneer: 100g (cut into cubes)
*   Onion: 1 (cut into petals)
*   Tomato: 1 (cut into quarters)
*   Capsicum: 1 (cut into squares)
*   Oil: 2 Tbsp
*   Wooden skewers</p>
<p><strong>For marinade:</strong>
*   Thick curd: ½ cup
*   Ginger-garlic paste: 1 tsp
*   Turmeric: ½ tsp
*   Kashmiri red chili powder: 1 tsp
*   Cumin powder: ½ tsp
*   Coriander powder: 1 tsp
*   Garam masala: ½ tsp
*   Chaat masala: ½ tsp
*   Salt: to taste
*   Roasted kasoori methi: ½ tsp
*   Roasted gram flour/sattu: 2 Tbsp
*   Lemon juice: 1 Tbsp
*   Oil: 1 Tbsp</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  Mix all the ingredients for the marinade well.
2.  Marinate the Paneer, onion, tomato, and capsicum and rest for at least 30 minutes.
3.  Put the vegetables onto wooden skewers.
4.  Heat a pan. Put some oil.
5.  Roast the skewered vegetables on all sides.
6.  Serve hot with green chutney, lemon wedges, and onion salad.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking tips:</strong>
*   The minimum marinating time is 30 minutes, but you can marinate for 4-5 hours.
*   If you don't have wooden skewers, you can skip them and saute the ingredients directly on the pan.
*   Massage the marinade into the paneer and vegetables to ensure they are evenly coated.
*   Don't turn the skewers immediately after placing them on the pan. Let them cook for a bit so the marinade doesn't stick to the pan.
*   Allow the vegetables and paneer to char slightly for a more authentic flavor.</p>

                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>"My tip is that sometimes what happens is that you have one particular size of refrigerator and then you want to upgrade. So, many times you take a huge double door or a four-door fridge. My advice is that somehow I feel it is always convenient in the kitchen to have two refrigerators even if small." The reason is that "one can be exclusively for the milk and milk products and the other odorless things in the kitchen, whereas the second one can be the things in which you know you want to keep them separate, just cooked vegetables or raw fruits. You don't want the smells of these things to intermingle with that of the milk."</p>
