                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Dhokla is a savory snack that is popular in India. It is made from a fermented batter of gram flour and spices, and is steamed until fluffy and spongy. This recipe is an instant version of the dish, using Eno fruit salt to leaven the batter instead of fermentation. The dhokla is then tempered with a mixture of mustard seeds, curry leaves, green chilies, sugar, salt, and lemon juice, which adds a burst of flavor and moisture to the dish. The result is a light, tangy, and slightly spicy snack that is perfect for any time of day. The recipe also includes a helpful tip for making the dhokla ahead of time, which is perfect for parties or gatherings.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>For dhokla batter:
*   Besan (1 cup + 1 Tbsp)
*   Sugar (1 Tbsp, powdered)
*   Salt (1 tsp)
*   Haldi (1/4 tsp)
*   Oil (1 Tbsp)
*   Lemon juice (1 Tbsp)
*   Crushed ginger (1 tsp)
*   Crushed green chillies (1 tsp)
*   Hing (1/4 tsp)
*   Eno (1 tsp)
*   Water to mix</p>
<p>For seasoning:
*   Oil (2 Tbsp)
*   Mustard seeds (1 tsp)
*   Green chillies (4, slit)
*   Curry leaves (8 to 10)
*   Sugar (1 Tbsp)
*   Salt (1/2 tsp)
*   Water (3/4 cup)
*   Lemon juice (1 Tbsp)
*   Sesame seeds (1 tsp, optional)</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In a mixing bowl, mix all ingredients for the dhokla batter, except Eno. Make a thick batter, whisk for 4 to 5 minutes, in one direction only, and rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Grease a dish in which you will steam the dhokla. Put a big pan /kadai with a lid and water, for steaming , on the flame.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes, add the Eno fruit salt to the batter. Whisk well, till frothy. Immediately, pour the batter into the greased dish and put to steam with lid, for about 20 minutes. </li>
<li>To prepare the tempering, put a pan on flame and add oil. Add the hing, mustard seeds and curry leaves. Once the mustard seeds start to splutter, add the green chillies. Add water, sugar and salt. Once it comes to a boil, add the lemon juice, mix well and put off the flame. Let it rest to cool down.</li>
<li>Once dhokla is done, let it rest for about 15 to 20 minutes. Gently take it out in a plate(upside down) , cut into desired cubes and pour all of the tempering on top. Let this rest for at least 3 to 4 hours before using. Garnish with chopped coriander and grated coconut(optional) before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cooking tip:</strong>
*   The dish size should be adjusted to the amount of batter being used. If the dish is too large, the batter will spread too thinly.
*   The tempering should not be boiling hot when added to the dhokla. It should be at room temperature.
*   The dhokla can be made a day ahead of time. After putting the tempering on, cover the dish with the same dish it was made in and put it in the fridge. This will keep the dhokla from drying out.</p>

                    <p>Wall-to-wall carpeting is a very common thing which we especially see in the European or the American houses. But somehow I feel that the Indian climatic conditions are not very suitable to for wall-to-wall carpeting. Rather than that, what I recommend to my clients always is use of smaller rugs. You could use any carpets or rugs of small size.</p>
