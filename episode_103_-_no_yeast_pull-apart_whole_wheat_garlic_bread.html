                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>If you are building a new house and you want to paint the walls, normally two to three coats are given over the primer. The tip is that after the primer is applied and the first coat of paint is applied, don't immediately apply the second coat. Only after the finishing, after your fans have been put up, after your light fixtures have been put up, so that any smudges that might occur on the walls can be taken care of, should you apply the second and final coat of paint.</p>
