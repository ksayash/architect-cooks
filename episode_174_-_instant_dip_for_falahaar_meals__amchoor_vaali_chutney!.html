                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When designing a house or an apartment, and where toilets come on the external walls, for the sake of elevational improvements, we give a duct type of covering to hide the PHE pipes. So when you are designing ducts, give ample space between the pipes and the surface of the duct. It should be open on one side so that the plumber can easily work on those ducts if need be.</p>
