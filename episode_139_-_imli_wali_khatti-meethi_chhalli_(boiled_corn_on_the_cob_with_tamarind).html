                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>This recipe is a traditional, guilt-free snack that is perfect for the rainy season. It is a chatpata, or spicy, snack that is sure to please. The recipe uses corn on the cob, also known as bhutta or challi, and is flavored with tamarind pulp, sweet imli chutney, and spices. The American sweet corn is recommended because it is a little sweet in taste and very soft. This makes it flavorful and easy to eat. This recipe is a great way to enjoy a delicious and healthy snack without any guilt.</p>

                    <p>One of the major requirements that has now become a necessity instead of a luxury is putting up CCTV cameras for the sake of security. If your new house is being built, then you can give the CCTV wiring and things become simple. But if your existing house or for some reason during construction, if you are not able to give that wiring, then nowadays we have some wireless CCTV cameras also, which just need to be screwed to the desired location and then connected via wifi and they work just as well. You don't want the wires to hang around all around the building.</p>
