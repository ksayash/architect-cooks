                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When designing surfaces in a home, it is not necessary to use the same surface throughout the room. It is better to give a mix of some surfaces, not too many, but varied surfaces can be mixed together to break the monotony and it looks very nice. For example, in a kitchen, you can use tile work for some surfaces and plastic emulsion paint over brick walls for other surfaces.</p>
