                <h2>Architecture Tip</h2>
                <div class="architecture-tip">
                    <p>When designing or constructing a house, remember to leave a minimum comfortable area on all sides for proper light and ventilation. Land is a scarce commodity, and there is a temptation to build on every inch. However, leaving space around the house is essential for services like toilets, kitchens, balconies, and rainwater pipes. Without adequate space, living in the house will not be pleasant.</p>
