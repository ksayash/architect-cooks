<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong>
*   When cooking with butter, add oil to the pan first. This will prevent the butter from burning.
*   It is important to cook the mushrooms until they are golden brown and have shrunk in size. This will help to bring out their flavor.
*   When adding the milk and water mixture, be sure to stir constantly to prevent lumps from forming.</p>

                    <p>"Giving accessory racks in the kitchen" is a great way to make working in the kitchen simpler. "Where your gas burner is, whether it is a new kitchen you are making, or even in kitchens which you are already using, and if you don't have these, just go to the market, pick them up, put them on the wall right next to the burner and see how easy your life becomes while cooking." By having your most used items within reach, you can save time and effort while cooking.</p>
