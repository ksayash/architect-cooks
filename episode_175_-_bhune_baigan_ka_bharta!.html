                <h2>What makes this dish special</h2>
                <p>Baingan Bharta is a traditional North Indian dish made with roasted eggplant, onions, and tomatoes. The eggplant is roasted over an open flame until the skin is blackened and the flesh is soft, giving it a smoky flavor. The dish is then cooked with a blend of spices, creating a rich and savory flavor. This recipe includes peas for a pop of color and texture. It is a versatile dish that can be served as a main course or a side dish. The key to a good Baingan Bharta is to use the round eggplant, as the long eggplant does not produce the same flavor.</p>

                <h2>Recipe</h2>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
*   450-500g round eggplant
*   4 Tbsp oil
*   1 ½ cup chopped onion
*   2-3 chopped green chilies
*   ¾ cup chopped tomatoes
*   2 Tbsp tomato puree
*   ½ cup peas (frozen or fresh)
*   Salt to taste
*   2 tsp Kashmiri red chili powder
*   3 tsp coriander powder
*   ¼ tsp garam masala powder
*   1 Tbsp chopped coriander</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
1.  Roast the eggplant over an open flame until the skin is blackened and the flesh is soft. Peel and mash the eggplant.
2.  Heat oil in a kadai. Add the green chilies and onion. Sauté until transparent.
3.  Add the tomatoes. Cook until soft.
4.  Add the green peas and cook until soft.
5.  Add the salt, red chili powder, and coriander powder. Mix well.
6.  Add the tomato puree. Once oil leaves sides, add the roasted eggplant.
7.  Sauté for 5-6 minutes.
8.  Serve hot, garnished with green coriander and garam masala.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Tips:</strong>

*   When roasting the eggplant, slit it in the middle to check for worms.
*   Use a little more oil than usual, as eggplant tends to soak it up.</p>

                    <p>Whether you're living in a house or an apartment, especially in a place like India where the monsoon is very heavy, the rain happens at an angle. So our windows need protection. A mistake that happens during construction is that the chajja (overhang) is cast straight. When you plaster, make the plaster thicker where the chajja joins the wall, and thinner as it goes out, so that the water drains out and doesn't seep into the wall.</p>
